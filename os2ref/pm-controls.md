# OS/2 Presentation Manager — Standard Control Classes

Presentation Manager ships a set of **preregistered window classes** — the buttons, entry
fields, list boxes, scroll bars, containers, notebooks, and other controls every PM
application builds its user interface from. Each is a public window class already registered
by the system; an application uses one simply by naming its `WC_*` class name in
`WinCreateWindow` / `WinCreateStdWindow` or in a dialog template, without registering a class
of its own. This reference documents each class's purpose, its principal styles, the messages
an application sends it, and the notifications it sends back to its owner. It is the companion
to `pm-window-messaging.md`, which covers the underlying window / message *model* (the anchor
block, the message queue, the window procedure, the core `WM_*` set, painting, and dialogs);
that model is assumed here and not repeated.

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** the IBM OS/2 Presentation Manager Programming Reference — the
per-control chapters "Control Window Message Processing" (button, entry field, container,
frame, static, list box, menu, scroll bar, slider, spin button, value set, title bar,
combination box, notebook) and the "Data Types" chapter, cited as `pm3.txt` / `pm4.txt`; the
Notebook Controls guide chapter (`pm5.txt`) — for every semantic claim (purpose, style meaning,
notification meaning). **[DOC-IBM]** the version-correct OS/2 Toolkit 4.5 headers `pmwin.h`,
`pmmle.h`, and `pmstddlg.h` — for every symbol name, constant value, message id, and structure
layout, cited as `file:line`. Where the book supplies meaning and the header supplies a value,
both are cited. A claim not confirmable in a header or the book is omitted.

## 1. How controls work [DOC-IBM]

A control is a child window of a system-provided class. The system implements each class's
window procedure; the application interacts with a control entirely through **messages** — it
*sends* the control class-specific messages (`BM_*`, `EM_*`, `LM_*`, `CM_*`, …) to query or
change its state, and the control *notifies* its owner when a significant event occurs.

**The predefined control classes** [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:241-262`; purposes from PM Reference,
pm3.txt "Control Window Message Processing"]:

| Class name | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WC_FRAME` | `0xffff0001` | A composite window — the frame that carries a title bar, menu, borders, scroll bars, and a client window. |
| `WC_COMBOBOX` | `0xffff0002` | An entry field and a list box merged into a single control. |
| `WC_BUTTON` | `0xffff0003` | Buttons and boxes the operator selects by clicking or with the keyboard (push buttons, check boxes, radio buttons). |
| `WC_MENU` | `0xffff0004` | A list of items shown horizontally as an action bar or vertically as a pull-down; the command interface. |
| `WC_STATIC` | `0xffff0005` | Simple display items (text, icon, bitmap, box) that do not respond to keyboard or pointer events. |
| `WC_ENTRYFIELD` | `0xffff0006` | A single line of editable text. |
| `WC_LISTBOX` | `0xffff0007` | A list of text items from which the operator makes selections. |
| `WC_SCROLLBAR` | `0xffff0008` | Scroll bars by which the operator requests scrolling of an associated window's contents. |
| `WC_TITLEBAR` | `0xffff0009` | Displays the window title/caption and lets the operator move its owner. |
| `WC_MLE` | `0xffff000A` | A multiple-line editable text window (multi-line entry field). |
| `WC_SPINBUTTON` | `0xffff0020` | A scrollable ring of choices the operator spins through. |
| `WC_CONTAINER` | `0xffff0025` | Holds objects (programs, files, images, records) and displays them in several views. |
| `WC_SLIDER` | `0xffff0026` | Sets/displays/modifies a value by moving an arm along a shaft. |
| `WC_VALUESET` | `0xffff0027` | Selects one choice from a group of mutually exclusive choices, shown as images, colors, text, or numbers. |
| `WC_NOTEBOOK` | `0xffff0028` | Organizes information on tabbed pages the user turns through. |

### Owner-notification: `WM_CONTROL`, `WM_COMMAND`, `WM_HELP` [DOC-IBM pm3.txt]

A control notifies its owner in one of three ways [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:944,946,965`]:

| Message | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `WM_CONTROL` | `0x0030` | The general control notification. `mp1` packs the control **id** (`SHORT1FROMMP`) and a **notification code** (`SHORT2FROMMP`); `mp2` carries control-specific information (often the control's window handle). |
| `WM_COMMAND` | `0x0020` | Posted by a control that issues a command (a push button, a menu item). The command source is in the `CMDMSG` `source` field — `CMDSRC_PUSHBUTTON`, `CMDSRC_MENU`, `CMDSRC_ACCELERATOR`, `CMDSRC_OTHER`. |
| `WM_HELP` | `0x0022` | Posted when the operator requests help on the control (e.g. a `BS_HELP` button); source encoded as for `WM_COMMAND`. |

The `WM_CONTROL` packing (id in the low half of `mp1`, notification code in the high half) is
the shape every control's notification set below is delivered in [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "WM_CONTROL
(in Button Controls)"; packing macros in `pm-window-messaging.md` §2]. Two owner-draw
notifications, `WM_DRAWITEM` (`0x0036`) and `WM_MEASUREITEM` (`0x0037`), are sent to the owner
of an owner-drawn list box, menu, container, slider, or value set [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:971-972`].

Message-id numbering is grouped by control: the first characters of a message name identify the
control (`BM`/`BN` button, `EM`/`EN` entry field, `MLM`/`MLN` MLE, `LM`/`LN` list box,
`CBM`/`CBN` combo box, `SBM` scroll bar, `MM` menu, `SPBM`/`SPBN` spin button, `SLM`/`SLN`
slider, `VM`/`VN` value set, `CM`/`CN` container, `BKM`/`BKN` notebook, `TBM` title bar)
[DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Notation Conventions"].

---

## 2. `WC_FRAME` — frame window [DOC-IBM]

A frame is a composite window that groups a client window with its decorative and functional
frame controls (title bar, system menu, menu bar, borders, min/max buttons, scroll bars). A
standard frame is normally built with `WinCreateStdWindow` (see `pm-window-messaging.md` §4),
which selects the frame controls with `FCF_*` creation flags; the individual controls are child
windows found by the `FID_*` ids. The `FCF_*` creation flags and `FID_*` control ids are
documented in `pm-window-messaging.md` §4.

**Frame styles** (`FS_*`) — used when a frame is created from a dialog template [DOC-IBM
`pmwin.h:2720-2742`; meanings pm3.txt "Frame Control Styles"]:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FS_ICON` | `0x0001` | Load an icon from resources. |
| `FS_ACCELTABLE` | `0x0002` | Load an accelerator table. |
| `FS_SHELLPOSITION` | `0x0004` | The shell chooses position/size. |
| `FS_TASKLIST` | `0x0008` | Add the frame to the window/task list. |
| `FS_NOBYTEALIGN` | `0x0010` | Do not byte-align the window (no horizontal snapping). |
| `FS_NOMOVEWITHOWNER` | `0x0020` | Do not move when the owner moves. |
| `FS_SYSMODAL` | `0x0040` | System-modal frame. |
| `FS_DLGBORDER` | `0x0080` | Dialog border. |
| `FS_BORDER` | `0x0100` | Thin border. |
| `FS_SCREENALIGN` | `0x0200` | Position coordinates are relative to the screen's top-left. |
| `FS_MOUSEALIGN` | `0x0400` | Position coordinates are relative to the pointer at creation time. |
| `FS_SIZEBORDER` | `0x0800` | Sizing border. |
| `FS_AUTOICON` | `0x1000` | Auto-repaint the minimized icon. |
| `FS_STANDARD` | `0x000F` | `FS_ICON` + `FS_ACCELTABLE` + `FS_SHELLPOSITION` + `FS_TASKLIST`. |

**Frame messages** — the frame procedure processes layout, focus, and background messages sent
to a frame window; the principal ones are `WM_FORMATFRAME` (`0x0041`), `WM_UPDATEFRAME`
(`0x0042`), `WM_FOCUSCHANGE` (`0x0043`), `WM_MINMAXFRAME` (`0x0046`), `WM_TRANSLATEACCEL`
(`0x004b`), `WM_ERASEBACKGROUND` (`0x004f`), and `WM_QUERYFRAMEINFO` [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2794-2818`;
also `pm-window-messaging.md` §6 "Frame messages"].

---

## 3. `WC_TITLEBAR` — title bar; the system menu [DOC-IBM]

The title bar (`WC_TITLEBAR`, `0xffff0009`) displays the window's title/caption and lets the
operator move the owner window by dragging it [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Control Window Message
Processing"]. In a standard frame it is the child with id `FID_TITLEBAR` (`0x8003`).

**Title-bar messages** [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2930-2931`]:

| Message | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TBM_SETHILITE` | `0x01e3` | Set the title bar's highlight (active/inactive) state. |
| `TBM_QUERYHILITE` | `0x01e4` | Query the highlight state. |

The title text is read and written with the generic `WinQueryWindowText` / `WinSetWindowText`
and with `WM_QUERYWINDOWPARAMS` / `WM_SETWINDOWPARAMS`.

**The system menu** is *not* a distinct window class — there is no `WC_SYSMENU` class constant.
It is a `WC_MENU` control instance carrying the frame-control id `FID_SYSMENU` (`0x8002`)
[DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:241-262` (no `WC_SYSMENU` present); `FID_SYSMENU` in `pm-window-messaging.md`
§4]. It is manipulated with the menu messages of §5.

---

## 4. `WC_BUTTON` — buttons and boxes [DOC-IBM]

A button control is a small rectangular child window the operator can "switch" on or off by
clicking it or by pressing the space bar when it has the focus. Buttons may be used alone or in
groups, labeled or not, and change appearance when clicked; a disabled button is drawn in a
different emphasis and does not respond [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Button Control Window Processing"].

**Button styles** (`BS_*`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1979-2003`; meanings pm3.txt "Button Control
Styles"]:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BS_PUSHBUTTON` | `0` | A box containing a string; notifies the parent when pushed. |
| `BS_CHECKBOX` | `1` | A square with a label; checked/unchecked; the owner sets the state. |
| `BS_AUTOCHECKBOX` | `2` | Check box that toggles its own state on click. |
| `BS_RADIOBUTTON` | `3` | Like a check box, used in groups where one is checked; owner manages the group. |
| `BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON` | `4` | Radio button that checks itself and unchecks the others in its group automatically. |
| `BS_3STATE` | `5` | Check box that can also be half-toned (a third, indeterminate state). |
| `BS_AUTO3STATE` | `6` | Three-state check box that cycles its state on click. |
| `BS_USERBUTTON` | `7` | Application-drawn button; its owner receives `BN_PAINT`. |
| `BS_NOTEBOOKBUTTON` | `8` | A push button that becomes part of a notebook page's common button area when it is a child of a notebook page. |
| `BS_TEXT` | `0x0010` | Text on the button (combine with `BS_BITMAP`/`BS_ICON`/`BS_MINIICON` to show both). |
| `BS_MINIICON` | `0x0020` | A mini-icon (half-size) on a push button. |
| `BS_BITMAP` | `0x0040` | A bitmap instead of text (push button only). |
| `BS_ICON` | `0x0080` | An icon instead of text (push button only). |
| `BS_HELP` | `0x0100` | Posts `WM_HELP` instead of `WM_COMMAND`. |
| `BS_SYSCOMMAND` | `0x0200` | Posts `WM_SYSCOMMAND` instead of `WM_COMMAND`. |
| `BS_DEFAULT` | `0x0400` | Default push button (thick border); also activated by Enter/Return. |
| `BS_NOPOINTERFOCUS` | `0x0800` | Does not take the focus when clicked with the pointer. |
| `BS_NOBORDER` | `0x1000` | Push button drawn without a border. |
| `BS_NOCURSORSELECT` | `0x2000` | Auto-radio button does not select itself merely on gaining focus by arrow/tab. |
| `BS_AUTOSIZE` | `0x4000` | The button sizes itself to fit its contents. |
| `BS_PRIMARYSTYLES` | `0x000F` | Mask of the primary (mutually exclusive) button types. |

**Button messages** (`BM_*`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2042-2049`]:

| Message | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BM_CLICK` | `0x0120` | Simulate a click (as if the operator pressed the button). |
| `BM_QUERYCHECKINDEX` | `0x0121` | Return the 0-based index of the checked button within its group. |
| `BM_QUERYHILITE` | `0x0122` | Query the highlight (pressed) state. |
| `BM_SETHILITE` | `0x0123` | Set the highlight state. |
| `BM_QUERYCHECK` | `0x0124` | Query the check state (0 unchecked, 1 checked, 2 indeterminate). |
| `BM_SETCHECK` | `0x0125` | Set the check state. |
| `BM_SETDEFAULT` | `0x0126` | Set/clear the default-button emphasis. |
| `BM_AUTOSIZE` | `0x0128` | Resize the button to fit its contents. |

**Button notifications** (`BN_*`), delivered in `WM_CONTROL` / (for push buttons) `WM_COMMAND`
[DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2053-2055`; meanings pm3.txt "WM_CONTROL (in Button Controls)"]:

| Code | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BN_CLICKED` | `1` | The button has been pressed. |
| `BN_DBLCLICKED` | `2` | The button has been double-clicked. |
| `BN_PAINT` | `3` | A `BS_USERBUTTON` requires painting; `mp2` points to a `USERBUTTON` giving the draw state (`BDS_DISABLED`/`BDS_HILITED`/`BDS_DEFAULT`). |

**Button control data** — passed as `pCtlData` at creation [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2014-2020`]:

```c
typedef struct _BTNCDATA {   /* btncd */
    USHORT  cb;
    USHORT  fsCheckState;    /* initial check state    */

} USERBUTTON;
```

## 5. `WC_MENU` — menus [DOC-IBM]

A menu presents a list of items, shown horizontally as an action bar or vertically as a
pull-down; menus are the usual command interface [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Control Window Message
Processing"]. Selecting an item posts `WM_COMMAND` (or `WM_SYSCOMMAND`/`WM_HELP`) to the owner
with `CMDSRC_MENU`.

**Menu messages** (`MM_*`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2381-2403`]:

    USHORT  id;              /* command id                         */
    HWND    hwndSubMenu;     /* submenu window (if MIS_SUBMENU)     */
    ULONG   hItem;           /* item handle (bitmap/owner data)     */
} MENUITEM;
```

## 6. `WC_STATIC` — static display items [DOC-IBM]

A static control is a simple display item — text, an icon, a bitmap, a box, or a filled/framed
rectangle — that does not respond to keyboard or pointer events [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Static Control
Window Processing"]. It sends no notifications of its own.

## 10. `WC_COMBOBOX` — combination box [DOC-IBM]

A combination box merges an entry field and a list box into one control; the list is displayed
below the entry field [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Combination-Box Control Window Processing"]. Because it
is composed of the two, it also accepts the `EM_*` and `LM_*` messages of its parts.

## 11. `WC_SCROLLBAR` — scroll bar [DOC-IBM]

A scroll bar lets the operator request scrolling of an associated window's contents [DOC-IBM
pm3.txt "Scroll Bar Control Window Processing"]. A standalone scroll bar sends `WM_HSCROLL` /
`WM_VSCROLL` to its owner; the frame's `FID_HORZSCROLL` / `FID_VERTSCROLL` scroll bars send
those to the frame.

**Scroll-bar messages** (`SBM_*`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2618-2622`]:

## 12. `WC_SPINBUTTON` — spin button [DOC-IBM]

A spin button presents a scrollable ring of choices — either a numeric range or an
application-supplied array of strings — the operator spins through with up/down arrows [DOC-IBM
pm3.txt "Spin Button Control Window Processing"]. A **master** spin button owns the entry-field
and arrow visuals; one or more **servant** spin buttons share a master.

## 13. `WC_SLIDER` — slider [DOC-IBM]

A slider lets the user set, display, or modify a value by moving an arm along a shaft [DOC-IBM
pm3.txt "Slider Control Window Processing"]. It carries a scale of tick marks, optional detents,

## 15. `WC_CONTAINER` — container [DOC-IBM]

The container holds objects — programs, files, images, database records — and displays them in
several **views** [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Container Control Window Processing"]. It is the richest of
the standard controls: it owns a linked list of application **records**, an optional set of
**detail-column** field descriptors, and a control-wide `CNRINFO` block.

### The container model [DOC-IBM]

- **Records.** Each item is a record whose first member is a `RECORDCORE` (or, if the container
  is created `CCS_MINIRECORDCORE`, a smaller `MINIRECORDCORE`); an application subclasses it by
  allocating extra bytes past the core with `CM_ALLOCRECORD` and links records into the
  container with `CM_INSERTRECORD` [DOC-IBM pm3.txt "Container Control Styles and Selection
  Types"].
- **Views.** The `flWindowAttr` field of `CNRINFO` selects the view with `CV_*` flags: `CV_TEXT`
  (`0x0001`), `CV_NAME` (`0x0002`), `CV_ICON` (`0x0004`), `CV_DETAIL` (`0x0008`), `CV_FLOW`
  (`0x0010`), `CV_MINI` (`0x0020`), `CV_TREE` (`0x0040`), `CV_GRID` (`0x0080`) [DOC-IBM
  `pmstddlg.h:1085-1093`], combined with title attributes `CA_*` (`CA_CONTAINERTITLE`
  `0x0200`, `CA_DETAILSVIEWTITLES` `0x8000`, `CA_TREELINE` `0x00400000`, …) [DOC-IBM
  `pmstddlg.h:1098-1111`].
- **Detail columns.** In detail view, each column is a `FIELDINFO`; columns are allocated with
  `CM_ALLOCDETAILFIELDINFO` and inserted with `CM_INSERTDETAILFIELDINFO`. A column's `flData`
  and `flTitle` carry `CFA_*` alignment/type flags (`CFA_LEFT` `0x0001`, `CFA_STRING` `0x0800`,
  `CFA_BITMAPORICON` `0x0100`, `CFA_DATE` `0x2000`, `CFA_TIME` `0x4000`, …) [DOC-IBM

### Using a container in practice [OBS-RE]

Everything below follows from one fact: **the container owns the record storage, not the
application.** A first container that ignores this compiles and then misbehaves in ways that look
unrelated to memory.

- **Allocate records with `CM_ALLOCRECORD`, never `malloc`.** `mp1` is the number of extra bytes
  wanted *beyond* the core, `mp2` how many records. `CM_FREERECORD` (or `CM_REMOVERECORD` with
  `CMA_FREE`) releases them.
- **`cb` in the core is the size of the CORE**, `sizeof(MINIRECORDCORE)` or `sizeof(RECORDCORE)` —
  not the size of your subclassed record. Setting it to the subclass size is a natural mistake and
  the control believes you.
- **The `PSZ` fields must point at storage that outlives the insert.** The container keeps the
  pointer, it does not copy the string, so pointing `pszIcon`/`pszText` at a local buffer leaves the
  control rendering freed stack. Put the text in the extra bytes you allocated past the core — that
  is what they are for, and their lifetime is exactly the record's.
- **The record struct must match the container's style.** `CCS_MINIRECORDCORE` means records are
  `MINIRECORDCORE`; without it they are `RECORDCORE`. The style lives in the `.RC` and the struct in
  the `.C`, so nothing checks that they agree.
- **Set the view through `CNRINFO.flWindowAttr` + `CM_SETCNRINFO`** with `CMA_FLWINDOWATTR`, e.g.
  `CV_NAME | CV_MINI | CV_FLOW` for a flowed mini-icon list — that combination needs no `FIELDINFO`
  columns at all, unlike `CV_DETAIL`.
- **Insert with a `RECORDINSERT`** whose `pRecordOrder` is `(PRECORDCORE)CMA_END` and `zOrder`
  `CMA_TOP`. Set `fInvalidateRecord = FALSE` while bulk-filling and send one
  `CM_INVALIDATERECORD` at the end.
- **`CN_ENTER` (double-click / Enter) arrives via `WM_CONTROL` with a `NOTIFYRECORDENTER *` in
  `mp2`** — one more payload shape behind that message, so check `SHORT2FROMMP(mp1)` before
  dereferencing (see `pm-window-messaging.md`).

For a plain directory listing the records come from `DosFindFirst`/`DosFindNext`, and per-file icons
from `WinLoadFileIcon(path, FALSE)` — the `FALSE` asks for a *shared* pointer, which is what you want
when only displaying it. A container record carries its own `HPOINTER`, so nothing like a Win32
image list is required.

### Key container structures [DOC-IBM]

**`RECORDCORE`** — the record base for the full record model [DOC-IBM `pmstddlg.h:1160-1176`]:

```c
typedef struct _RECORDCORE {   /* recc */
    ULONG       cb;
    ULONG       flRecordAttr;         /* CRA_* record attributes         */
    POINTL      ptlIcon;              /* icon-view position              */
    struct _RECORDCORE *preccNextRecord;
    PSZ         pszIcon;              /* text for CV_ICON                */
    HPOINTER    hptrIcon;             /* icon (non-mini)                 */
    HPOINTER    hptrMiniIcon;         /* icon (CV_MINI)                  */
    HBITMAP     hbmBitmap;            /* bitmap (non-mini)               */
    HBITMAP     hbmMiniBitmap;        /* bitmap (CV_MINI)                */
    PTREEITEMDESC pTreeItemDesc;      /* tree-view icons                 */
    PSZ         pszText;              /* text for CV_TEXT                */
    PSZ         pszName;              /* text for CV_NAME                */
    PSZ         pszTree;              /* text for CV_TREE                */
} RECORDCORE;
```

**`MINIRECORDCORE`** — the compact record base (`CCS_MINIRECORDCORE`) [DOC-IBM
`pmstddlg.h:1181-1189`]:

```c
typedef struct _MINIRECORDCORE {   /* minirec */
    ULONG       cb;
    ULONG       flRecordAttr;
    POINTL      ptlIcon;
    struct _MINIRECORDCORE *preccNextRecord;
    PSZ         pszIcon;
    HPOINTER    hptrIcon;
} MINIRECORDCORE;
```

**`FIELDINFO`** — one detail-view column [DOC-IBM `pmstddlg.h:1142-1154`]:

```c
typedef struct _FIELDINFO {   /* fldinfo */
    ULONG      cb;
    ULONG      flData;                /* CFA_* data attributes/type      */
    ULONG      flTitle;               /* CFA_* title attributes          */
    PVOID      pTitleData;            /* column-heading string or HBITMAP*/
    ULONG      offStruct;             /* offset from record to this cell */
    PVOID      pUserData;
    struct _FIELDINFO *pNextFieldInfo;
    ULONG      cxWidth;               /* column width in pels            */
} FIELDINFO;
```

**`CNRINFO`** — the container-wide control block (queried with `CM_QUERYCNRINFO`, changed with
`CM_SETCNRINFO`) [DOC-IBM `pmstddlg.h:1208-1242`]:

```c
typedef struct _CNRINFO {   /* ccinfo */
    ULONG       cb;
    PVOID       pSortRecord;          /* sort comparison function        */
    PFIELDINFO  pFieldInfoLast;       /* last column in the left split   */
    PFIELDINFO  pFieldInfoObject;     /* column that receives in-use emph*/
    PSZ         pszCnrTitle;          /* container title                 */
    ULONG       flWindowAttr;         /* CV_* view + CA_* title attrs    */
    POINTL      ptlOrigin;            /* icon-view virtual origin        */
    ULONG       cDelta;               /* delta threshold                 */
    ULONG       cRecords;             /* number of records               */
    SIZEL       slBitmapOrIcon;       /* icon/bitmap size in pels        */
    SIZEL       slTreeBitmapOrIcon;   /* tree icon/bitmap size           */
    HBITMAP     hbmExpanded;          /* tree "expanded" bitmap          */
    HBITMAP     hbmCollapsed;         /* tree "collapsed" bitmap         */
    HPOINTER    hptrExpanded;         /* tree "expanded" icon            */
    HPOINTER    hptrCollapsed;        /* tree "collapsed" icon           */
    LONG        cyLineSpacing;        /* row spacing                     */
    LONG        cxTreeIndent;         /* child indent                    */
    LONG        cxTreeLine;           /* tree-line thickness             */
    ULONG       cFields;              /* number of detail columns        */
    LONG        xVertSplitbar;        /* split-bar position (0xFFFF=none)*/
} CNRINFO;
```

## 16. `WC_NOTEBOOK` — notebook [DOC-IBM]

A notebook organizes information on individual **pages** the user turns through, with **tabs**
(major and minor sections), an optional **status line**, a binding, and — in the "new" style — a
common **button area** and a page list [DOC-IBM pm5.txt "Notebook Controls"]. Each page is
identified by a page id (`ULONG`) and is associated with an application window or dialog whose
contents fill the page (`BKM_SETPAGEWINDOWHWND`). The book supports both an "old" and a "new"
visual style, selected by the `BKS_*` style bits.

**Notebook styles** (`BKS_*`) [DOC-IBM `pmstddlg.h:2038-2082`; meanings pm5.txt "Notebook Styles"]
— back-page corner (`BKS_BACKPAGESBR` `0x0001`, `BKS_BACKPAGESBL` `0x0002`, `BKS_BACKPAGESTR`
`0x0004`, `BKS_BACKPAGESTL` `0x0008`), major-tab edge (`BKS_MAJORTABRIGHT` `0x0010`,
`BKS_MAJORTABLEFT` `0x0020`, `BKS_MAJORTABTOP` `0x0040`, `BKS_MAJORTABBOTTOM` `0x0080`), tab shape
(`BKS_SQUARETABS` `0x0000`, `BKS_ROUNDEDTABS` `0x0100`, `BKS_POLYGONTABS` `0x0200`), binding
(`BKS_SOLIDBIND` `0x0000`, `BKS_SPIRALBIND` `0x0400`), status-text justification
(`BKS_STATUSTEXTLEFT` `0x0000`, `BKS_STATUSTEXTRIGHT` `0x1000`, `BKS_STATUSTEXTCENTER` `0x2000`),
tab-text justification (`BKS_TABTEXTLEFT` `0x0000`, `BKS_TABTEXTRIGHT` `0x4000`,
`BKS_TABTEXTCENTER` `0x8000`), and `BKS_TABBEDDIALOG` (`0x0800`) for a tabbed-dialog notebook.
