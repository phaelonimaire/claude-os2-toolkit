# OS/2 Internals Reference

A **project-agnostic** reference on how OS/2 (Warp 4 / 4.5) works internally — the boot
sequence, kernel structures, ABIs, and subsystem contracts — synthesized and verified from
IBM primary sources and reverse engineering of the real OS/2 binaries.

## Why this exists
OS/2's internals are absent from LLM training data and scattered across the IBM DDK, the
OS/2 Toolkits, redbooks, and decaying community archives. This corpus collects the verified
facts in one ingestible place so **any** OS/2 project — or any model — can use them as
reference. It describes **OS/2 itself** — the system's own behaviour and interfaces, independent of
any particular implementation or codebase that consumes it.

## Provenance — every fact is sourced
Much of this is reverse-engineered, so each claim is tagged with how it was established, so a
reader knows what is IBM's word versus an observation of the binaries, and can re-verify it:

- **[DOC-IBM]** — IBM documentation: the DDK (`infoseg.h`, `devhlp.inc`, the PDD / GRADD /
  DISPLAY reference books), the OS/2 Toolkit headers (`bsedos.h`, `bsedev.h`), redbooks.
  Authoritative for **meaning** — units, semantics, error codes.
- **[OBS-RE]** — observed by reverse-engineering the real OS/2 binaries (the debug kernel
  `os2krnl` + symbols, `PMMERGE`, `PMDD`, …) or the OS/2 kernel debugger on real hardware / a
  VM. Authoritative for **shape** — offsets, sizes, call order — and for facts IBM never
  documented. This is an interpretation of the binary; it is marked so it is never mistaken
  for IBM's word.
- **[DOC]** — other published references (osFree, EDM2), cross-checked.
- **[SRC]** — read directly from the source of a component that is *not* OS/2 itself but ships
  with it or on it, with file and line cited (e.g. kLIBC / LIBC Next, in
  `klibc-runtime-glue.md`). Authoritative for **what that component actually does** — it is the
  implementation, not a description of it — but it is *not* IBM's word about OS/2, and it can
  change with the component's version in a way an OS/2 ABI fact cannot. Where a `[SRC]` reading
  and a `[DOC-IBM]` statement disagree about OS/2 itself, `[DOC-IBM]` describes the platform and
  `[SRC]` describes that one implementation's behaviour on it.
- **[unverified]** — an inline marker on an individual claim the author could not confirm against
  any source at hand (used sparingly, in place of asserting it); everything else is sourced.

A doc may also carry a dated **"Ratified"** note. That records a pass where the doc's claims were
re-checked field-by-field against a named primary (a Toolkit/DDK header, an IBM book) and either
confirmed, upgraded to `[DOC-IBM]`, or corrected in place. It is a statement about *that* review,
not a guarantee: a doc without one has simply not had that second pass, and its own per-claim
provenance tags still apply.

Canonical **IBM names** are used throughout (`InfoSegGDT`, `SIS_FgndPID`, `DosQuerySysInfo`),
never a project's transcription of them.

## How to read this corpus
Start with **`boot-sequence.md`** — the 12-stage spine that names every subsystem and links to its
deep reference. From there, the **internals** docs explain how the system works; the
**application-programming** docs are the API surface a program calls (grouped below by area) and are
each self-contained (a struct or flag may be repeated across docs by design, so any one reads on its
own). Most docs end with a **See also** pointing to their closest neighbours.

## Kernel variant
OS/2 ships **uniprocessor** and **SMP** kernel variants. Where they differ (e.g. the local
InfoSeg is 36 bytes on the uniprocessor kernel, 44 on SMP), **both forms are given** and the
difference noted. An SMP kernel runs correctly on a single CPU (it reports one processor);
the LIS form follows the kernel *variant*, not the CPU count.

Each deep reference documents one subsystem's structures and ABIs to full field-level
