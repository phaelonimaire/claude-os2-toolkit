# OS/2 Module and Dynamic-Link-Library Management

How an OS/2 program locates, loads, and calls code in a dynamic link library (DLL): the
run-time module-manager API (`DosLoadModule`, `DosFreeModule`, `DosQueryProcAddr`,
`DosQueryModuleHandle`, `DosQueryModuleName`, `DosQueryProcType`), the DLL model itself
(load-time versus run-time linking, import by name versus by ordinal, the `_DLL_InitTerm`
library entry point and its per-process versus global forms, exported entry points and
forwarders), and how a module-definition (`.DEF`) file declares what a module exports and
imports. This reference covers the module *interface*; the on-disk executable/DLL container
layout (the LX/NE segment and object tables) is in `executable-formats.md`, and the `_System`
linkage plus the full `.DEF` `LIBRARY`/`EXPORTS`/`IMPORTS` syntax are in `calling-convention.md`
and are not duplicated here.

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** the OS/2 Toolkit header `bsedos.h` (all module-manager prototypes,
`INCL_DOSMODULEMGR`), `os2def.h` (`HMODULE`, `PFN` types), the OS/2 Linear-eXecutable reference
`lxref.htm` (the library initialization/termination register-and-stack contract and the
module-flag bits), a Toolkit `SAMPLES` DLL entry point and `.DEF` files (the `_DLL_InitTerm`
prototype and the `LIBRARY … INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE` form); **[DOC]** the IBM OS/2 2.0
Programming Guide (GG24-3774) "Dynamic Link Libraries" / "Creating a DLL" / "Using a DLL" and the
Control Program reference stubs (the OS/2 1.x names and load-failure buffer). Every prototype and
constant below is transcribed from a source file that was opened; nothing is supplied from memory.

## The dynamic-linking model [DOC / DOC-IBM]

A DLL is a module containing code and/or resources that one or more programs share at run time
rather than binding a private copy at link time. Multiple processes use the same memory-resident
copy of the DLL code, and the code in a DLL can be changed without re-linking the programs that
use it. [DOC — GG24-3774 "Dynamic Link Libraries".] A program resolves the external references to
a DLL's exported entry points in one of two ways:

- **Load-time (implicit) linking.** The reference is resolved by the loader when the program
  module is loaded: the executable records an import of "export *N* (or export name *S*) of module
  *M*", and the loader loads *M* and binds the reference before the program runs. The program
  declares these imports through an `IMPORTS` statement in its `.DEF` file, or by linking against an
  **import library** (built with `IMPLIB` from a `.DEF`); the system's own `OS2386.LIB` / `OS2.LIB`
  is itself an import library describing the DLLs that implement the OS/2 API. [DOC — GG24-3774
  "Using a DLL".]
- **Run-time (explicit) linking.** The program has no compile-time reference; it calls
  `DosLoadModule` to load a named DLL, `DosQueryProcAddr` to obtain the address of an entry point
  (by name or by ordinal), calls through the returned function pointer, and `DosFreeModule` when
  finished. [DOC-IBM — `bsedos.h`.]

Both forms reach the same exported code; the calling convention (`_System` for 32-bit,
`_Far16 _Pascal` for 16-bit — see `calling-convention.md`) is a property of the declared prototype,
independent of which linking method or which reference form (name/ordinal) resolved it.

### Import by name versus by ordinal [DOC-IBM]

Each export a DLL provides is identified both by its name and by a small integer **ordinal**
assigned in the `.DEF` `EXPORTS` statement (`name @N`). An importer may bind to an export **by
ordinal** (`MODULE.N`) — the compact, position-stable form used for the core system DLLs
(`DOSCALLS`, `PMWIN`, …) — or **by name** (`MODULE.EXPORTNAME`), resolved by string match. The
`.DEF` syntax for both is documented in `calling-convention.md` ("Ordinal vs by-name imports").

---

## The run-time module-manager API

All prototypes are declared under `#ifdef INCL_DOSMODULEMGR` in `bsedos.h`. `HMODULE` is a module
handle (`typedef LHANDLE HMODULE`, i.e. `unsigned long`; `PHMODULE` is its pointer —
`os2def.h:232,242`); `PFN` is an `APIENTRY`-linkage function pointer (`os2def.h:112`). Every
function returns an `APIRET` (0 = success, non-zero `ERROR_*`). [DOC-IBM — `bsedos.h`, `os2def.h`.]

| Symbol | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DosLoadModule` | Load a DLL by name (run-time linking); return its handle, or the name of the object that caused a load failure |
| `DosFreeModule` | Release a handle obtained from `DosLoadModule`; unload the DLL when its use count reaches zero |
| `DosQueryProcAddr` | Get the address of an exported entry point, by ordinal or by name |
| `DosQueryModuleHandle` | Get the handle of an already-loaded module, by name |
| `DosQueryModuleName` | Get the fully-qualified file name of a module, from its handle |
| `DosQueryProcType` | Report whether a given entry point is 16-bit or 32-bit code |
| `DosQueryModFromEIP` | Identify the module (and object/offset) containing a given code address |
| `DosReplaceModule` | Replace an in-use module file with a new one (or restore a backup) |

### `DosLoadModule` [DOC-IBM]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosLoadModule(PSZ pszName, ULONG cbName, PSZ pszModname, PHMODULE phmod);
```
(`bsedos.h:2142-2151`; `PCSZ` in the C++ variant.)

The parameter naming is easy to misread: `pszModname` (parameter 3) is the **input** — the name of
the module to load — and `pszName`/`cbName` (parameters 1–2) are an **output error buffer** and its
length, into which the loader writes the name of the object (typically a dependent module) that
caused the load to fail when the call returns an error. A Toolkit sample illustrates the argument
order — `DosLoadModule(szLoadError, sizeof(szLoadError), szDevDLLName, &hModHandle)`
(`SAMPLES/MM/ADMCT/loadsubs.c`, shown in a commented-out reference line). `phmod` receives the
module handle on success.

If the named module is already loaded, its existing handle is returned and its use count is
incremented rather than a second image being mapped; the module is not physically unloaded until
every `DosLoadModule` is matched by a `DosFreeModule`.

The 16-bit predecessor took the same argument order — an object-name buffer (returned), the buffer
length, the module-name string, and the returned handle — under the OS/2 1.x name (see "Naming"
below). [DOC — Control Program reference `DosLoadModule` stub.]

### `DosFreeModule` [DOC-IBM]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosFreeModule(HMODULE hmod);
```
(`bsedos.h:2153`.) Releases one reference to `hmod`. The module image is unloaded — and its
per-process termination routine (below) run — when the last reference in the process is freed.

### `DosQueryProcAddr` [DOC-IBM]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryProcAddr(HMODULE hmod, ULONG ordinal, PSZ pszName, PFN *ppfn);
```
(`bsedos.h:2156-2165`; `PCSZ` in the C++ variant.) Returns, in `*ppfn`, a callable pointer to an
export of `hmod`. The export is selected **by ordinal** if `ordinal` is non-zero, otherwise **by
name** using the string `pszName`. The returned pointer is invoked with the convention of its
declared prototype.

The `ordinal` must be ≤ 65 533, and the name match is not case sensitive. For entries within the
`DOSCALLS` module only **ordinal** references are supported — a by-name reference to `DOSCALLS`
returns an error — which is why `DOSCALLS` ordinals are resolved by linking against `OS2386.LIB`.
If the call returns `ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE`, the module may not be loaded; reissue `DosLoadModule`
and repeat. [DOC — EDM2 "DosQueryProcAddr".]

| `rc` | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NO_ERROR` | `0` | Address returned in `*ppfn` |
| `ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE` | `6` | `hmod` is not a valid loaded-module handle |
| `ERROR_INVALID_NAME` | `123` | `pszName` does not name an export of the module |
| `ERROR_INVALID_ORDINAL` | `182` | `ordinal` does not name an export of the module |
| `ERROR_ENTRY_IS_CALLGATE` | `65079` | The entry point is reachable only via a call gate |

[DOC — EDM2 "DosQueryProcAddr".]

### `DosQueryModuleHandle` [DOC-IBM]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryModuleHandle(PSZ pszModname, PHMODULE phmod);
```
(`bsedos.h:2168-2173`; `PCSZ` in the C++ variant.) Returns, in `*phmod`, the handle of a module
that is **already loaded**, located by name. Unlike `DosLoadModule` it does not load the module and
does not change its use count.

### `DosQueryModuleName` [DOC-IBM]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryModuleName(HMODULE hmod, ULONG cbName, PCHAR pch);
```
(`bsedos.h:2175-2177`.) The inverse of `DosQueryModuleHandle`: writes the fully-qualified file
name of the module identified by `hmod` into the caller's buffer `pch` of length `cbName`.

### `DosQueryProcType` [DOC-IBM]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryProcType(HMODULE hmod, ULONG ordinal, PSZ pszName, PULONG pulproctype);
```
(`bsedos.h:2183-2192`.) Selects an export the same way as `DosQueryProcAddr` (by `ordinal` if
non-zero, else by `pszName`) and reports its code width in `*pulproctype`:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PT_16BIT` | `0` | The entry point is 16-bit code |
| `PT_32BIT` | `1` | The entry point is 32-bit code |

(`bsedos.h:2179-2180`.) This lets a caller thunking across the 16/32 boundary discover which
convention a resolved entry point actually uses (see `thunking.md`).

### `DosQueryModFromEIP` and `DosReplaceModule` (related) [prototypes DOC-IBM; behavior inferred from the parameter names]

```c
APIRET APIENTRY DosQueryModFromEIP(HMODULE *phMod, ULONG *pObjNum, ULONG BuffLen,
                                   PCHAR pBuff, ULONG *pOffset, ULONG Address);
APIRET APIENTRY DosReplaceModule(PSZ pszOldModule, PSZ pszNewModule, PSZ pszBackupModule);
```
(`bsedos.h:2194-2199, 2213-2220`.) `DosQueryModFromEIP` maps a code address (`Address`) back to the
module handle, object number, name, and offset that contain it — the basis of a symbolic
backtrace. `DosReplaceModule` swaps a module's on-disk file (optionally saving a backup) so a
loaded module can be updated. (The prototypes are transcribed from `bsedos.h`; the header carries
no descriptive prose, so the behavioral summaries above are read from the parameter names, not a
documented sentence.) The related function `DosQueryModFromCS` — the callable Toolkit symbol is
`Dos16QueryModFromCS` (`bsedos.h:2233`), `DosQueryModFromCS` being the documentation-level name in
the header comment — returns a `QMRESULT` `{ USHORT seg; USHORT hmte; CHAR name[CCHMAXPATH]; }`
(`bsedos.h:2225-2229`); it and `QMRESULT` are guarded `#if __IBMC__ || __IBMCPP__` (IBM-compiler only).

The `DosReplaceModule` behavior read from the parameter names above is confirmed by community
documentation: the function loads the entire in-use module (`pszOldModule`) into memory and
releases the filesystem's hold on the file, optionally copies the current image to
`pszBackupModule`, then replaces the on-disk file with `pszNewModule`; the system keeps using the
cached old module until every reference is released, and the next reference reloads from the new
file. Only protect-mode executable/DLL files may be replaced (not DOS/Windows programs or data
files); `pszNewModule` and `pszBackupModule` may be NULL. The entry point is `DOSCALLS.417` and is
defined in `OS2386.LIB`. [DOC — EDM2 "DosReplaceModule".]

| `rc` | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NO_ERROR` | `0` | Module replaced (or cached) |
| `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | `2` | A named file does not exist |
| `ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND` | `3` | A named path does not exist |
| `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` | `5` | Access to a named file was denied |
| `ERROR_NOT_THE_SAME_DEVICE` | `17` | Files are not on the same device |
| `ERROR_NOT_DOS_DISK` | `26` | Target is not a recognized disk |
| `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` | `32` | A sharing conflict on a named file |
| `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER` | `87` | A parameter is invalid |
| `ERROR_DRIVE_LOCKED` | `108` | The drive is locked |
| `ERROR_DISK_FULL` | `112` | No space to cache/back up the module |
| `ERROR_DIRECTORY` | `267` | A name refers to a directory |
| `ERROR_MODULE_IN_USE` | `296` | Module-in-use condition |
| `ERROR_MODULE_CORRUPTED` | `731` | The replacement module image is corrupt |

## The `_DLL_InitTerm` entry point [DOC-IBM]

A DLL may name a single **library entry routine** that the loader calls when a process gains or
loses access to the DLL. By convention the C runtime supplies this routine under the name
`_DLL_InitTerm`; a Toolkit sample gives its exact prototype and behaviour:

```c
unsigned long _System _DLL_InitTerm(unsigned long handle, unsigned long flag);
```
(`SAMPLES/OPEN32/DLLENTRY/dllmain.c:47`.) It receives the DLL's own module `handle` and a `flag`
selecting the direction:

| `flag` | Direction | Meaning (from the sample's own comments) |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | **Initialization** | "A process is gaining access to this DLL" |
| non-zero | **Termination** | "A process is losing access to this DLL" |

The return value reports success: a **non-zero** return means the routine succeeded, and a **zero**
return means it failed (the sample returns `0` when `_CRT_init()` fails and `TRUE` otherwise). On
initialization the routine performs C-runtime setup and C++ static constructors
(`_CRT_init`, `__ctordtorInit`); on termination it runs destructors and C-runtime teardown
(`__ctordtorTerm`, `_CRT_term`). [DOC-IBM — `SAMPLES/OPEN32/DLLENTRY/dllmain.c:47-95`.]

### The underlying loader contract [DOC-IBM]

`_DLL_InitTerm` sits on top of the module's declared **library entry address**. The LX executable
reference specifies the register/stack state at which the loader enters that address. On
**initialization** and **termination** the loader enters with (`lxref.htm`, "Library initialization
/ termination registers"):

| Location | Value |
|---|---|
| `EIP` | Library entry address |
| `CS` | Code selector for the base of the linear address space |
| `DS = ES = SS` | Data selector for the base of the linear address space |
| `FS` | Data selector for the base of the Thread Information Block (TIB) |
| `GS`, `EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, `ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP` | `0` |
| `[ESP+0]` | Return address to the system (`EAX` = return code) |
| `[ESP+4]` | Module handle for the library module |
| `[ESP+8]` | `0` = Initialization, `1` = Termination |

This is exactly the `(handle, flag)` pair `_DLL_InitTerm` receives — `[ESP+4]` is `handle`,
`[ESP+8]` is `flag` — so `flag == 0` is init and `flag == 1` (non-zero) is termination, agreeing
with the sample. A library whose entry-address object number is **zero** has no entry routine.
[DOC-IBM — `lxref.htm`.]

### Per-process versus global initialization/termination [DOC-IBM]

Whether the entry routine runs **once per process** that attaches to the DLL or **once globally**
for the whole system is fixed by two module flags recorded in the DLL's header
(`lxref.htm`, module flags):

| Flag | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Per-Process Library Initialization | `0x00000004` | Entry routine runs on init **for each process** that gains access |
| Per-process Library Termination | `0x40000000` | Entry routine runs on term for each process that loses access |

When the initialization bit is **not** set (but a valid entry address exists), **Global Library
Initialization** is assumed — the routine runs only once — and likewise for termination. If the
per-process **termination** bit is set, the entry-address object must be a 32-bit object. Setting
either bit is invalid for a program (`.EXE`) module. [DOC-IBM — `lxref.htm`.]

These flags are chosen through the `.DEF` `LIBRARY` statement. The `INITINSTANCE` and
`TERMINSTANCE` keywords request the **per-process** (instance) form — "any initialization code
should be executed for each process which accesses the DLL" — e.g.
`LIBRARY MYDLL INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE` (IBM redbook GG24-3774 p.122; also
`SAMPLES/TCPIPTK/SAMPDLL/sampdllm.def`). Absent those keywords the global form (single init/term)
applies. [DOC-IBM — GG24-3774 "Creating a DLL"; Toolkit `.DEF` samples.] A DLL accessed by
separate processes generally also declares `DATA MULTIPLE` so each process gets its own copy of the
DLL's data segment. [DOC — GG24-3774 "Creating a DLL".]

## Exported entry points and forwarders

### Exportable entry points [DOC]

An **exportable entry point** is a function invoked from outside its own module — either called
explicitly by another module or called back by the system (a window procedure invoked by
Presentation Manager is the canonical example). [DOC — GG24-3774 glossary "exportable entry
point".] A DLL lists each such function in its `.DEF` `EXPORTS` statement, optionally pinning an
ordinal (`name @N`) and optionally aliasing an external name to a different internal one
(`externalname=internalname`); the full syntax is in `calling-convention.md`.

### Forwarders [DOC / OBS-RE]

An export entry need not name code in its own module: it may **forward** to an export of another
module, so that a reference resolved to `A.foo` is transparently satisfied by `B.bar`. This lets a
DLL re-export another DLL's entry points (or rename/relocate an API across module boundaries)
without a stub. In OS/2, forwarders are used heavily by the thin system DLLs that re-export the
kernel's `DOSCALLS` entries. The forwarder is recorded in the module's entry table as a reference
to a target module + target export (by name or ordinal); the on-disk encoding of a forwarder entry
belongs to `executable-formats.md`. [DOC — the LX entry-table forwarder form; OBS-RE — the system
DLLs that forward into `DOSCALLS`.]

---

## Where the PM APIs actually live [OBS-RE]

**The DLL you link against is usually not the DLL that implements the function.** The `Win*` API
surface is spread across several modules, and the most-linked one is almost entirely forwarders.
This matters whenever you are resolving an ordinal, diagnosing `SYS2070`, replacing a module, or
interposing on an API — reasoning from the linked name will send you to the wrong binary.

Verify on the target system before relying on any row: the split is a property of the installed
build, not of the API.

| Module | What it really is |
|---|---|
| `PMWIN.DLL` | **Almost entirely forwarders into `PMMERGE`.** On Warp Server for e-business CP2 (XR04503) it is ~11 KB with **738 entry-table slots, every one a forwarder, and one imported module: `PMMERGE`**. It contains essentially no code. |
| `PMGPI.DLL` | The `Gpi*` surface, likewise thin over `PMMERGE`. |
| `PMMERGE.DLL` | The actual window manager + GPI engine + GRE dispatch. |
| `PMCTLS.DLL` | **Real code.** Owns the standard dialogs: `WINFONTDLG` @2, `WINDEFFONTDLGPROC` @3, `WINFILEDLG` @4, `WINDEFFILEDLGPROC` @5, `WINFREEFILEDLGLIST` @6. 254 exports, **zero** forwarders. |
| `PMSDMRI.DLL` | **Resource-only** — 0 exports, 0 imports, one read-only data object. Holds the standard dialog *templates* (the file dialog is `RT_DIALOG` id 256) and nothing else. |
| `PMSHAPI.DLL`, `PMDRAG.DLL`, `PMWP.DLL` | Shell API, direct manipulation, Workplace Shell class API. |

Two practical consequences:

- **Applications bind these by ordinal, at load time.** The OS/2 System Editor (`E.EXE`) imports
  `PMCTLS #2, #3, #4, #5` — i.e. the font and file dialog entry points — with no names involved.
  When you replace a module you must reproduce its **ordinals**, not just its names.
- **A resource-only module can only be changed cosmetically.** Swapping `PMSDMRI.DLL` alters how
  a standard dialog *looks*; it cannot alter what it *does*, because there is no code in it.
  Behaviour lives in `PMCTLS`.

Establish these facts yourself with `tools/lx_export.py` (`--exports` / `--imports`) rather than
trusting the table; that is exactly what it is for, and it takes one command per module.

## Naming: `DosQueryProcAddr` versus `DosGetProcAddr` [DOC-IBM / DOC]

Several dynamic-linking function names were changed in OS/2 2.0 "to conform to the consistent
naming rules introduced in OS/2 Version 2.0." [DOC — GG24-3774 "Dynamic Linking".] The 32-bit
module-manager API therefore uses `DosQueryProcAddr` (`bsedos.h`), whereas the OS/2 1.x
(16-bit) Control Program used `DosGetProcAddr` for the same operation — get the address of an
exported procedure by name (`Control Program reference DosGetProcAddr` stub). `DosLoadModule` and
`DosFreeModule` kept their names across the transition. When reading older documentation, treat
`DosGetProcAddr` as the historical spelling of `DosQueryProcAddr`; the 32-bit toolkit does not
declare `DosGetProcAddr`. [DOC-IBM — `bsedos.h` (present: `DosQueryProcAddr`); absent:
`DosGetProcAddr`.]
