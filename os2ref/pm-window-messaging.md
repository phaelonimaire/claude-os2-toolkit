# OS/2 Presentation Manager — Windows and Message Programming

The application programming model a Presentation Manager (PM) program is built on: the anchor
block and per-thread message queue an application must establish before it can call PM, the
window class / window procedure model, the get-and-dispatch message loop, the core `WM_*`
message set, painting, and dialogs. This is the **API surface a PM program calls and the
contract its window procedure must honour** — the message queue's internal delivery and kernel
wake are covered separately in `message-queue.md`, and the drawing path a `WM_PAINT` feeds is
covered in `pm-graphics.md`.

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** the OS/2 Toolkit header `pmwin.h` and the base type header `os2def.h`
(every prototype, structure, and constant below is transcribed from them); **[DOC-IBM]** the IBM
OS/2 PM Programming Reference for API semantics. Where a behavioural claim is not stated by a
header it is tagged **[DOC]**.

## 1. The anchor block and the message queue [DOC-IBM]

Two things are per-application/per-thread and must exist before any window can:

- An **anchor block** (`HAB`, *hab*) — a thread's handle to the PM environment. A thread that
  will call PM window functions obtains one with `WinInitialize`.
- A **message queue** (`HMQ`, *hmq*) — created with `WinCreateMsgQueue`. **Each thread that
  creates windows, or that receives messages, must have its own message queue** [DOC]; a queue
  belongs to the thread that created it. A thread with windows but no queue cannot receive
  input or `WM_PAINT`.

Both handles are `LHANDLE` (`unsigned long`) [DOC-IBM `os2def.h:76,258,599`].

| Symbol | Prototype (from `pmwin.h`) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinInitialize` | `HAB APIENTRY WinInitialize(ULONG flOptions)` | Register the calling thread with PM; returns its anchor block (`NULLHANDLE` on failure). `flOptions` is reserved — pass 0. |
| `WinCreateMsgQueue` | `HMQ APIENTRY WinCreateMsgQueue(HAB hab, LONG cmsg)` | Create this thread's message queue. `cmsg` is the requested queue size in messages; 0 requests the default. |
| `WinDestroyMsgQueue` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinDestroyMsgQueue(HMQ hmq)` | Destroy the thread's queue. |
| `WinTerminate` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinTerminate(HAB hab)` | Release the anchor block and all PM resources the thread still owns. |
| `WinQueryAnchorBlock` | `HAB APIENTRY WinQueryAnchorBlock(HWND hwnd)` | Recover the anchor block associated with a window. |
| `WinQueryVersion` | `ULONG APIENTRY WinQueryVersion(HAB hab)` | PM version/environment. |
| `WinQueryQueueInfo` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinQueryQueueInfo(HMQ hmq, PMQINFO pmqi, ULONG cbCopy)` | Fill an `MQINFO` describing a queue. |

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** `pmwin.h:409-415, 1040-1047`.

The canonical startup/shutdown sequence for a PM thread is therefore
`WinInitialize` → `WinCreateMsgQueue` → (register classes, create windows, run the message loop)
→ `WinDestroyMsgQueue` → `WinTerminate` [DOC].

### `MQINFO` — queue information [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1025-1033`]

```c
typedef struct _MQINFO {   /* mqi */
    ULONG   cb;            /* structure size                */
    PID     pid;           /* owning process                */
    TID     tid;           /* owning thread                 */
    ULONG   cmsgs;         /* number of messages in queue   */
    PVOID   pReserved;
} MQINFO;
```

### Predefined window handles [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:227-237`]

| Symbol | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HWND_DESKTOP` | `(HWND)1` | The desktop window; the root parent for top-level windows, and the `hwndDesktop` argument to many query functions. |
| `HWND_OBJECT` | `(HWND)2` | The object-window parent (a window with no presentation, for message-only use). |
| `HWND_TOP` | `(HWND)3` | Z-order top (for `hwndInsertBehind`). |
| `HWND_BOTTOM` | `(HWND)4` | Z-order bottom. |
| `HWND_THREADCAPTURE` | `(HWND)5` | Used with mouse capture. |

---

## 2. Message parameters — `MPARAM`, `MRESULT`, and packing [DOC-IBM]

A message carries two parameters and returns one result. All three are pointer-sized opaque
types:

```c
typedef VOID *MPARAM;    /* mp   */    /* os2def.h:591 */
typedef VOID *MRESULT;   /* mres */    /* os2def.h:593 */
```

Because they are opaque, PM defines a family of macros to pack standard scalar types into an
`MPARAM`/`MRESULT` and to unpack them again. **These macros are the ABI for how a message's data
is laid out in its two parameters** — a window procedure reads its `mp1`/`mp2` with the
`*FROMMP` macros exactly as the sender wrote them with the `MPFROM*` macros.

| Pack (into `MPARAM`) | Definition | Unpack (from `MPARAM`) | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MPVOID` | `((MPARAM)0L)` | `PVOIDFROMMP(mp)` | `((VOID *)(mp))` |
| `MPFROMP(p)` | `((MPARAM)((ULONG)(p)))` | `HWNDFROMMP(mp)` | `((HWND)(mp))` |
| `MPFROMHWND(hwnd)` | `((MPARAM)(HWND)(hwnd))` | `CHAR1FROMMP(mp)` | `((UCHAR)((ULONG)mp))` |
| `MPFROMCHAR(ch)` | `((MPARAM)(USHORT)(ch))` | `CHAR2FROMMP(mp)` | `((UCHAR)((ULONG)mp >> 8))` |
| `MPFROMSHORT(s)` | `((MPARAM)(USHORT)(s))` | `CHAR3FROMMP(mp)` | `((UCHAR)((ULONG)mp >> 16))` |
| `MPFROM2SHORT(s1,s2)` | `((MPARAM)MAKELONG(s1,s2))` | `CHAR4FROMMP(mp)` | `((UCHAR)((ULONG)mp >> 24))` |
| `MPFROMSH2CH(s,c1,c2)` | `((MPARAM)MAKELONG(s,MAKESHORT(c1,c2)))` | `SHORT1FROMMP(mp)` | `((USHORT)(ULONG)(mp))` |
| `MPFROMLONG(l)` | `((MPARAM)(ULONG)(l))` | `SHORT2FROMMP(mp)` | `((USHORT)((ULONG)mp >> 16))` |
| | | `LONGFROMMP(mp)` | `((ULONG)(mp))` |

The `MRESULT` side mirrors this: `MRFROMP`, `MRFROMSHORT`, `MRFROM2SHORT`, `MRFROMLONG` to
build a result, and `PVOIDFROMMR`, `SHORT1FROMMR`, `SHORT2FROMMR`, `LONGFROMMR` to read one.

The key packing idiom is `MPFROM2SHORT(low, high)` — two 16-bit values packed into one parameter,
low half in bits 0–15 and high half in bits 16–31 — recovered with `SHORT1FROMMP` (low) and
`SHORT2FROMMP` (high). Many messages use it (e.g. `WM_SIZE` carries the new width and height this
way, `WM_COMMAND` carries the command id).

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** `pmwin.h:172-205`, `os2def.h:591-594`.

## 3. The window procedure [DOC-IBM]

Every window class has a **window procedure** (`PFNWP`) — the function PM calls to deliver each
message. Its signature is fixed:

```c
typedef MRESULT (EXPENTRY FNWP)(HWND, ULONG, MPARAM, MPARAM);   /* pmwin.h:223 */
typedef FNWP *PFNWP;
```

That is, `MRESULT EXPENTRY WndProc(HWND hwnd, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2)`. The procedure
switches on `msg`, interprets `mp1`/`mp2` according to that message (Section 6), and returns an
`MRESULT`. **Any message it does not handle it must pass to `WinDefWindowProc`**, which supplies
the system default behaviour:

```c
MRESULT APIENTRY WinDefWindowProc(HWND hwnd, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2);   /* pmwin.h:330 */
```

A window procedure must be exported (named in the module definition file) so PM can call it
across the module boundary. Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** `pmwin.h:208-224, 330-333`.

### Subclassing an existing window [DOC-IBM]

To change the behaviour of a window whose class you do not own — a push button, an entry field, a
frame — replace its window procedure:

```c
PFNWP APIENTRY WinSubclassWindow(HWND hwnd, PFNWP pfnwp);   /* pmwin.h:746-747 */
```

It installs `pfnwp` and **returns the procedure it displaced**. Save that pointer: it is the only
way to reach the original behaviour. Thereafter every message sent or posted to the window arrives
at the new procedure first. [DOC-IBM `pmv2base.txt` — "An application subclasses a window by using
the `WinSubclassWindow` function to replace the window's original window procedure".]

> **A subclass procedure must chain to the saved procedure, NOT to `WinDefWindowProc`.** This is the
> one rule that inverts the normal habit of §3. Everything that makes a button a button — its
> painting, its keyboard handling, its `WM_COMMAND` notifications — lives in the class procedure you
> just displaced, and `WinDefWindowProc` knows none of it. Send unhandled messages to the system
> default instead of the saved procedure and the control keeps its appearance for a moment but stops
> behaving like a control. [DOC-IBM `pmv2base.txt` — "If the new window procedure does not process a
> particular message, it must pass the message to the original window procedure, not to
> `WinDefWindowProc`, for default processing".]

Store the saved `PFNWP` in a **window word** (§9) rather than a global when more than one instance
may be subclassed — one global holds one procedure, and the second subclassed control overwrites
the first, so the two instances chain into each other.

Note that OS/2 uses "subclass" for two unrelated things: this, and the SOM/WPS sense of deriving a
class (`som.md`, `wps-classes.md`). Container records are subclassed in a third sense again
(`pm-controls.md`). They share no mechanism.

---

## 4. Registering a class and creating windows [DOC-IBM]

### `WinRegisterClass` [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:317-328`]

```c
BOOL APIENTRY WinRegisterClass(HAB hab, PSZ pszClassName, PFNWP pfnWndProc,
                               ULONG flStyle, ULONG cbWindowData);
```

Registers an application window class: its name, its window procedure, its default class style
(`CS_*`), and `cbWindowData` — the number of extra bytes of storage to reserve in every window of
this class (the *window words*, Section 9).

**Class styles** (`flStyle`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:299-308`]:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CS_MOVENOTIFY` | `0x00000001` | Window is sent notification when moved. |
| `CS_SIZEREDRAW` | `0x00000004` | Whole window is redrawn on any size change. |
| `CS_HITTEST` | `0x00000008` | Window receives `WM_HITTEST`. |
| `CS_PUBLIC` | `0x00000010` | Class is public (visible to all processes). |
| `CS_FRAME` | `0x00000020` | Class is a frame class. |
| `CS_CLIPCHILDREN` | `0x20000000` | Exclude child windows from the window's drawing. |
| `CS_CLIPSIBLINGS` | `0x10000000` | Exclude sibling windows. |
| `CS_PARENTCLIP` | `0x08000000` | Clip to the parent. |
| `CS_SAVEBITS` | `0x04000000` | Save the bits the window obscures. |
| `CS_SYNCPAINT` | `0x02000000` | Paint synchronously (send `WM_PAINT` immediately rather than queuing). |

`WinRegisterClass` returns `TRUE` on success and `FALSE` on failure; on failure the reason is
retrievable with `WinGetLastError` [DOC — EDM2 "WinRegisterClass"]:

| Error | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PMERR_PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE` | `0x1003` | A parameter was out of range (e.g. a private class name clashing with a public class in the same process). |
| `PMERR_INVALID_HATOMTBL` | `0x1013` | An invalid atom-table handle was passed. |
| `PMERR_INVALID_ATOM_NAME` | `0x1015` | An invalid atom-name string was given. |
| `PMERR_INVALID_INTEGER_ATOM` | `0x1016` | The atom specified is not a valid integer atom. |
| `PMERR_ATOM_NAME_NOT_FOUND` | `0x1017` | The atom name given was not in the atom table. |
| `PMERR_INVALID_FLAG` | `0x1019` | An invalid bit was set for a parameter. |
| `PMERR_INVALID_PARAMETERS` | `0x1208` | One or more parameters were invalid. |

Class-name and lifetime semantics [DOC — EDM2 "WinRegisterClass"]: a private class name must not
clash with the name of a public class in the same process (that returns `FALSE` /
`PMERR_PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE`); a private class may, however, override an older private class of
the same name, in which case the new parameters replace the old ones. Private classes are
discarded when the owning process terminates. `CS_PUBLIC` may only be specified by the shell
process (a class registered by a DLL loaded by the shell at startup) — an application registering
its own class leaves it off.

### Predefined (system) window classes [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:241-275`]

Class names of the form `((PSZ)0xffff00nnL)` are the built-in PM control classes:

| Constant | Value | Control |
|---|---|---|
| `WC_FRAME` | `0xffff0001` | Frame window |
| `WC_COMBOBOX` | `0xffff0002` | Combination box |
| `WC_BUTTON` | `0xffff0003` | Push/check/radio button |
| `WC_MENU` | `0xffff0004` | Menu |
| `WC_STATIC` | `0xffff0005` | Static text/icon |
| `WC_ENTRYFIELD` | `0xffff0006` | Single-line entry field |
| `WC_LISTBOX` | `0xffff0007` | List box |
| `WC_SCROLLBAR` | `0xffff0008` | Scroll bar |
| `WC_TITLEBAR` | `0xffff0009` | Title bar |
| `WC_MLE` | `0xffff000A` | Multi-line entry field |
| `WC_SPINBUTTON` | `0xffff0020` | Spin button |
| `WC_CONTAINER` | `0xffff0025` | Container |
| `WC_SLIDER` | `0xffff0026` | Slider |
| `WC_VALUESET` | `0xffff0027` | Value set |
| `WC_NOTEBOOK` | `0xffff0028` | Notebook |

### `WinCreateWindow` [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:439-452`]

```c
HWND APIENTRY WinCreateWindow(HWND hwndParent, PSZ pszClass, PSZ pszName, ULONG flStyle,
                              LONG x, LONG y, LONG cx, LONG cy,
                              HWND hwndOwner, HWND hwndInsertBehind, ULONG id,
                              PVOID pCtlData, PVOID pPresParams);
```

The general window-creation primitive: parent, class name, text, window style (`WS_*`), position
and size, owner, Z-order insertion point, child id, class-specific control data, and presentation
parameters.

**Window styles** (`flStyle`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:280-295`]:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WS_VISIBLE` | `0x80000000` | Window is visible. |
| `WS_DISABLED` | `0x40000000` | Window is disabled (no input). |
| `WS_CLIPCHILDREN` | `0x20000000` | Clip out children when drawing. |
| `WS_CLIPSIBLINGS` | `0x10000000` | Clip out siblings. |
| `WS_PARENTCLIP` | `0x08000000` | Clip to parent. |
| `WS_SAVEBITS` | `0x04000000` | Save obscured bits. |
| `WS_SYNCPAINT` | `0x02000000` | Synchronous painting. |
| `WS_MINIMIZED` | `0x01000000` | Created minimized. |
| `WS_MAXIMIZED` | `0x00800000` | Created maximized. |
| `WS_ANIMATE` | `0x00400000` | Animate show/hide. |
| `WS_GROUP` | `0x00010000` | Dialog: first control of a group. |
| `WS_TABSTOP` | `0x00020000` | Dialog: a tab stop. |
| `WS_MULTISELECT` | `0x00040000` | Dialog: multiple-selection control. |

#### Building a transient overlay — tooltip, call tip, dropdown [OBS-RE]

An overlay that must be able to **overhang** its owner (a tooltip, a call tip, an autocomplete list)
cannot be a child of the window it belongs to, because a child is clipped to its parent. The PM
pattern separates the two relationships that Win32 tends to conflate:

```c
hwndTip = WinCreateWindow(
    HWND_DESKTOP,        /* PARENT: the desktop, so the overlay is not clipped   */
    "MyTipClass", "",
    WS_CLIPSIBLINGS,     /* NOT WS_VISIBLE - created hidden, shown on demand     */
    0, 0, 0, 0,
    hwndOwner,           /* OWNER: the window it belongs to; gets notifications  */
    HWND_TOP, 0, NULL, NULL);
```

Points worth knowing before you debug them:

- **Register the class `CS_SAVEBITS`.** PM then saves the pixels the overlay covers and restores them
  when it goes away, instead of forcing the window underneath through a repaint on every dismissal.
  That is what the style is for; a transient overlay is the case it was designed around.
- **It will not steal the focus.** PM gives a window the focus only when something calls
  `WinSetFocus` for it, so typing keeps going to the owner while the overlay is up. Nothing extra is
  needed — unlike Win32, where a plain popup can take activation unless you prevent it.
- **Attach your instance pointer *after* `WinCreateWindow` returns**, with `WinSetWindowPtr`, and have
  the window procedure ignore messages that arrive before it is set. That is simpler than decoding
  the pointer out of `WM_CREATE`, and the early messages have nothing to do anyway.
- **If the overlay paints, set its drawing surface up against its OWN window handle**, not the
  owner's. Anything that flips y (and on PM that is anything drawing in a top-down coordinate system)
  computes the flip from the window it was given, so passing the owner silently offsets every
  primitive by the difference in their heights.

Position it with `WinMapWindowPoints` to convert the owner's coordinates to the desktop's, then
`WinSetWindowPos`.

### `WinCreateStdWindow` [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2772-2781`]

```c
HWND APIENTRY WinCreateStdWindow(HWND hwndParent, ULONG flStyle, PULONG pflCreateFlags,
                                 PSZ pszClientClass, PSZ pszTitle, ULONG styleClient,
                                 HMODULE hmod, ULONG idResources, PHWND phwndClient);
```

Creates a **standard frame window** — a `WC_FRAME` window together with the frame controls
selected by `*pflCreateFlags` (title bar, system menu, min/max buttons, borders, menu, etc.) and,
if `pszClientClass` is given, a **client window** of that class as the frame's child. The client
window handle is returned through `phwndClient`; the function's return value is the *frame*
handle. `hmod`/`idResources` name a resource module and resource id from which the frame loads a
menu, accelerator table, and icon.

**Frame creation flags** (`FCF_*`) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2686-2717`]:

| Constant | Value | Frame control |
|---|---|---|
| `FCF_TITLEBAR` | `0x00000001` | Title bar |
| `FCF_SYSMENU` | `0x00000002` | System menu |
| `FCF_MENU` | `0x00000004` | Action-bar menu |
| `FCF_SIZEBORDER` | `0x00000008` | Sizing border |
| `FCF_MINBUTTON` | `0x00000010` | Minimize button |
| `FCF_MAXBUTTON` | `0x00000020` | Maximize button |
| `FCF_MINMAX` | `0x00000030` | Both min and max buttons |
| `FCF_VERTSCROLL` | `0x00000040` | Vertical scroll bar |
| `FCF_HORZSCROLL` | `0x00000080` | Horizontal scroll bar |
| `FCF_DLGBORDER` | `0x00000100` | Dialog border |
| `FCF_BORDER` | `0x00000200` | Thin border |
| `FCF_SHELLPOSITION` | `0x00000400` | Let the shell choose position/size |
| `FCF_TASKLIST` | `0x00000800` | Add to the window/task list |
| `FCF_ICON` | `0x00004000` | Load an icon from resources |
| `FCF_ACCELTABLE` | `0x00008000` | Load an accelerator table |
| `FCF_SYSMODAL` | `0x00010000` | System-modal frame |
| `FCF_HIDEBUTTON` | `0x01000000` | Hide button |
| `FCF_CLOSEBUTTON` | `0x04000000` | Close button (when no min/max present) |
| `FCF_AUTOICON` | `0x40000000` | Auto-repaint minimized icon |
| `FCF_STANDARD` | `0x0000CC3F` | The common set: title bar, system menu, menu, sizing border, min/max, icon, accelerator table, shell position, task list |

**Frame control window IDs** (`FID_*`) — the child id of each frame control, usable with
`WinWindowFromID` to find it [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2868-2874`]:

| Constant | Value | Control |
|---|---|---|
| `FID_SYSMENU` | `0x8002` | System menu |
| `FID_TITLEBAR` | `0x8003` | Title bar |
| `FID_MINMAX` | `0x8004` | Min/max buttons |
| `FID_MENU` | `0x8005` | Menu |
| `FID_VERTSCROLL` | `0x8006` | Vertical scroll bar |
| `FID_HORZSCROLL` | `0x8007` | Horizontal scroll bar |
| `FID_CLIENT` | `0x8008` | Client window |

### `CREATESTRUCT` — the `WM_CREATE` parameter [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:717-733`]

`WM_CREATE` delivers, in `mp2`, a pointer to the `CREATESTRUCT` describing the window being
created (its fields mirror the `WinCreateWindow` arguments, in reverse order):

```c
typedef struct _CREATESTRUCT {   /* crst */
    PVOID   pPresParams;
    PVOID   pCtlData;
    ULONG   id;
    HWND    hwndInsertBehind;
    HWND    hwndOwner;
    LONG    cy;
    LONG    cx;
    LONG    y;
    LONG    x;
    ULONG   flStyle;
    PSZ     pszText;
    PSZ     pszClass;
    HWND    hwndParent;
} CREATESTRUCT;
```

## 5. The message loop [DOC-IBM]

The heart of a PM thread is the get-and-dispatch loop. Messages posted to the thread's queue are
retrieved with `WinGetMsg`, then handed to `WinDispatchMsg`, which calls the target window's
procedure.

| Symbol | Prototype (from `pmwin.h`) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinGetMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinGetMsg(HAB hab, PQMSG pqmsg, HWND hwndFilter, ULONG msgFilterFirst, ULONG msgFilterLast)` | Remove and return the next queued message into `*pqmsg`, blocking the thread until one is available. **Returns `FALSE` when the message is `WM_QUIT`** — the loop's termination signal — and `TRUE` otherwise. `hwndFilter`/`msgFilter*` restrict which messages are returned (all zero = no filter). |
| `WinDispatchMsg` | `MRESULT APIENTRY WinDispatchMsg(HAB hab, PQMSG pqmsg)` | Call the window procedure of `pqmsg->hwnd` with the message, returning its `MRESULT`. |
| `WinPeekMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinPeekMsg(HAB hab, PQMSG pqmsg, HWND hwndFilter, ULONG msgFilterFirst, ULONG msgFilterLast, ULONG fl)` | Non-blocking look at the queue; `fl` is `PM_REMOVE` (`0x0001`) to dequeue or `PM_NOREMOVE` (`0x0000`) to leave the message. Returns `FALSE` if no matching message. |

The idiomatic loop [DOC]:

```c
QMSG qmsg;
while (WinGetMsg(hab, &qmsg, NULLHANDLE, 0, 0))
    WinDispatchMsg(hab, &qmsg);
```

It runs until a `WM_QUIT` makes `WinGetMsg` return `FALSE`.

### `QMSG` — a dequeued message [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:901-911`]

```c
typedef struct _QMSG {   /* qmsg */
    HWND    hwnd;        /* target window            */
    ULONG   msg;         /* message id (WM_*)        */
    MPARAM  mp1;         /* first packed parameter   */
    MPARAM  mp2;         /* second packed parameter  */
    ULONG   time;        /* message time             */
    POINTL  ptl;         /* mouse position           */
    ULONG   reserved;
} QMSG;
```

### Sending vs. posting [DOC-IBM]

Two ways to deliver a message to a window:

| Symbol | Prototype | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `WinSendMsg` | `MRESULT APIENTRY WinSendMsg(HWND hwnd, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2)` | **Synchronous** — calls the target window procedure directly and returns its `MRESULT`. Does not go through the queue. |
| `WinPostMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinPostMsg(HWND hwnd, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2)` | **Asynchronous** — places the message on the target's queue and returns immediately (`TRUE` if queued). |
| `WinPostQueueMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinPostQueueMsg(HMQ hmq, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2)` | Post to a queue by handle rather than by window. |
| `WinBroadcastMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinBroadcastMsg(HWND hwnd, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2, ULONG rgf)` | Send/post to many windows; `rgf` selects `BMSG_POST 0`, `BMSG_SEND 0x0001`, `BMSG_POSTQUEUE 0x0002`, `BMSG_DESCENDANTS 0x0004`, `BMSG_FRAMEONLY 0x0008`. |
| `WinInSendMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinInSendMsg(HAB hab)` | `TRUE` if the current message is being processed as the result of a `WinSendMsg` from another thread. |

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** `pmwin.h:1035-1038, 1070-1073, 1161, 1164-1175, 1226-1229`.

### Queue status and message time [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1182-1202`]

`WinQueryQueueStatus(HWND hwndDesktop)` returns a bit mask of pending input classes: `QS_KEY`
(`0x0001`), `QS_MOUSEBUTTON` (`0x0002`), `QS_MOUSEMOVE` (`0x0004`), `QS_MOUSE` (`0x0006`),
`QS_TIMER` (`0x0008`), `QS_PAINT` (`0x0010`), `QS_POSTMSG` (`0x0020`), `QS_SENDMSG` (`0x0400`).
`WinQueryMsgPos` and `WinQueryMsgTime` return the mouse position and timestamp of the last
retrieved message.

---

## 6. The core message set [DOC-IBM]

Message ids are `WM_*` constants; those below `WM_USER` (`0x1000`) are system-defined, and an
application numbers its private messages from `WM_USER` upward. The interpretation of `mp1`/`mp2`
is per-message.

### Lifecycle and window-state messages [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:914-962`]

| Message | Value | Delivered when / carries |
|---|---|---|
| `WM_NULL` | `0x0000` | No-op / wake. |
| `WM_CREATE` | `0x0001` | Window is being created. `mp2` → `CREATESTRUCT`; `mp1` → control data. Returning `TRUE` aborts creation. |
| `WM_DESTROY` | `0x0002` | Window is being destroyed (last chance to release resources). |
| `WM_ENABLE` | `0x0004` | Enable state changed. |
| `WM_SHOW` | `0x0005` | Visibility changed. |
| `WM_MOVE` | `0x0006` | Window moved. |
| `WM_SIZE` | `0x0007` | Window resized. `mp1` = old (cx,cy), `mp2` = new (cx,cy), each two `SHORT`s (`SHORT1FROMMP`/`SHORT2FROMMP`). |
| `WM_ACTIVATE` | `0x000d` | Activation gained/lost. |
| `WM_SETFOCUS` | `0x000f` | Focus gained/lost (`mp2` = TRUE if gaining). |
| `WM_PAINT` | `0x0023` | The window has an invalid region to redraw (Section 7). |
| `WM_COMMAND` | `0x0020` | A command (menu/button/accelerator). See `CMDMSG` below. |
| `WM_SYSCOMMAND` | `0x0021` | A system command. |
| `WM_HELP` | `0x0022` | Help requested. |
| `WM_TIMER` | `0x0024` | A timer fired; `mp1` = `SHORT1FROMMP` timer id (Section 10). |
| `WM_CLOSE` | `0x0029` | The user asked to close the window. The default response posts `WM_QUIT`. |
| `WM_QUIT` | `0x002a` | Terminate the message loop (makes `WinGetMsg` return `FALSE`). |
| `WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE` | `0x002b` | System colors changed. |
| `WM_CONTROL` | `0x0030` | A control is notifying its owner. `SHORT1FROMMP(mp1)` = control id, `SHORT2FROMMP(mp1)` = notification code; **`mp2` means whatever that code says it means** — see below. |
| `WM_VSCROLL` / `WM_HSCROLL` | `0x0031` / `0x0032` | Scroll bar activity. |
| `WM_INITDLG` | `0x003b` | A dialog is initializing (Section 8). |
| `WM_MENUSELECT` | `0x0034` | Menu item highlighted. |

### `CMDMSG` — accessing `WM_COMMAND`/`WM_HELP`/`WM_SYSCOMMAND` [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1010-1020`]

```c
#pragma pack(1)
typedef struct _COMMANDMSG {   /* commandmsg */
    USHORT  cmd;       /* mp1 : the command id       */
    USHORT  unused;
    USHORT  source;    /* mp2 : CMDSRC_* origin      */
    USHORT  fMouse;    /* mp2 : mouse-initiated flag  */
} CMDMSG;
#define COMMANDMSG(pmsg) ((PCMDMSG)((PBYTE)pmsg + sizeof(MPARAM)))
```

The command source (`source`) is one of `CMDSRC_PUSHBUTTON` (1), `CMDSRC_MENU` (2),
`CMDSRC_ACCELERATOR` (3), `CMDSRC_FONTDLG` (4), `CMDSRC_FILEDLG` (5), `CMDSRC_PRINTDLG` (6),
`CMDSRC_COLORDLG` (7), or `CMDSRC_OTHER` (0) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:994-1002`].

### Frame messages [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:2794-2818`]

`WM_FOCUSCHANGE` (`0x0043`), `WM_ERASEBACKGROUND` (`0x004f`), `WM_FORMATFRAME` (`0x0041`),
`WM_UPDATEFRAME` (`0x0042`), `WM_MINMAXFRAME` (`0x0046`), `WM_TRANSLATEACCEL` (`0x004b`),
`WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED` (`0x0055`) — sent to frame windows to manage layout, focus, and the
background of the client.

### Mouse messages [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1313-1364`]

All carry the pointer position in `mp1` (two `SHORT`s: x = `SHORT1FROMMP`, y = `SHORT2FROMMP`, in
window coordinates) and hit-test/flags in `mp2`.

| Message | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WM_MOUSEMOVE` | `0x0070` | Pointer moved over the window. |
| `WM_BUTTON1DOWN` | `0x0071` | Button 1 pressed. |
| `WM_BUTTON1UP` | `0x0072` | Button 1 released. |
| `WM_BUTTON1DBLCLK` | `0x0073` | Button 1 double-click. |
| `WM_BUTTON2DOWN` | `0x0074` | Button 2 pressed. |
| `WM_BUTTON2UP` | `0x0075` | Button 2 released. |
| `WM_BUTTON2DBLCLK` | `0x0076` | Button 2 double-click. |
| `WM_BUTTON3DOWN` | `0x0077` | Button 3 pressed. |
| `WM_BUTTON3UP` | `0x0078` | Button 3 released. |
| `WM_BUTTON3DBLCLK` | `0x0079` | Button 3 double-click. |
| `WM_BEGINDRAG` | `0x0420` | Direct-manipulation drag began. |
| `WM_CONTEXTMENU` | `0x0424` | Context-menu request. |

`WM_MOUSEFIRST`/`WM_MOUSELAST` (`0x0070`/`0x0079`) bound the mouse-message range for message
filters.

### Mouse capture, pointer shape, and rubber-band tracking [DOC-IBM]

The messages above tell you *what happened*; these functions are how a window takes control of the
mouse while a drag is in progress.

| Symbol | Prototype (`pmwin.h`) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinSetCapture` | `BOOL WinSetCapture(HWND hwndDesktop, HWND hwnd)` [`pmwin.h:1305-1306`] | Route **all** mouse messages to `hwnd`. `hwnd` = `NULLHANDLE` releases the capture. |
| `WinQueryCapture` | `HWND WinQueryCapture(HWND hwndDesktop)` [`pmwin.h:1309`] | The window currently holding the capture. |
| `WinSetPointer` | `BOOL WinSetPointer(HWND hwndDesktop, HPOINTER hptrNew)` [`pmwin.h:3773-3774`] | Set the pointer shape. |
| `WinQueryPointer` | `HPOINTER WinQueryPointer(HWND hwndDesktop)` [`pmwin.h:3842`] | The current pointer. |
| `WinQueryPointerPos` | `BOOL WinQueryPointerPos(HWND hwndDesktop, PPOINTL pptl)` [`pmwin.h:3843-3844`] | Pointer position, in **desktop** coordinates. |
| `WinLoadPointer` | `HPOINTER WinLoadPointer(HWND hwndDesktop, HMODULE hmod, ULONG idres)` [`pmwin.h:3829-3831`] | Load a pointer from a resource. |
| `WinShowPointer` | `BOOL WinShowPointer(HWND hwndDesktop, BOOL fShow)` [`pmwin.h:3778-3779`] | Show/hide the pointer. |
| `WinTrackRect` | `BOOL WinTrackRect(HWND hwnd, HPS hps, PTRACKINFO pti)` [`pmwin.h:3568-3570`] | Run a modal rubber-band move/resize loop; returns `TRUE` if the user accepted. |

The first argument is a desktop handle: pass `HWND_DESKTOP`. These take one because pointer and
capture state is per-desktop, not per-window.

> **Without `WinSetCapture`, a button-up that happens outside your window never arrives.** Mouse
> messages go to the window under the pointer, so a drag that starts inside your window and ends
> outside it delivers the `WM_BUTTON1DOWN` and then simply stops — no `WM_BUTTON1UP`, no error. Any
> state you armed on button-down (a selection, a rubber band, a captured origin) stays armed
> forever, and the window behaves as though the button were still held. The fix is the standard
> pairing: capture on button-down, release with `WinSetCapture(HWND_DESKTOP, NULLHANDLE)` on
> button-up. [DOC-IBM `pm4.txt` — "Capturing mouse input is useful if a window needs to receive all
> mouse input, even when the pointer moves outside the window".]

> **Capturing to the *queue* rather than a window makes messages undispatchable.** `WinSetCapture`
> can route mouse input to the calling thread's queue instead, and then each `QMSG` arrives with
> `hwnd` set to `NULL`. `WinDispatchMsg` has no window to hand them to, so they never reach any
> window procedure — the message loop itself must handle them. If you take this route and keep an
> ordinary loop, mouse input vanishes silently. [DOC-IBM `pm4.txt`.]

> **If you handle `WM_MOUSEMOVE` and do not pass it on, the pointer shape stops being maintained.**
> Setting the pointer is *default* processing: `WinDefWindowProc` calls `WinSetPointer` on every
> `WM_MOUSEMOVE`. A window procedure that swallows the message inherits that job. So either call
> `WinSetPointer` yourself for the whole window, or return the message to `WinDefWindowProc` — a
> handler that does neither leaves whatever shape the last window set, which reads as "the pointer
> is stuck as an I-beam / hourglass over my window". This is also why the hourglass idiom must
> re-assert the shape from `WM_MOUSEMOVE` for the duration of a long operation, not just once
> before it. [DOC-IBM `pm3.txt` "WM_MOUSEMOVE — Default Processing"; `pmv2base.txt`.]

`WinTrackRect` drives the whole rubber-band interaction itself — it does not return until the user
commits or cancels. `TRACKINFO` [`pmwin.h:3551-3565`] supplies the border and grid sizes, the
starting `rclTrack`, an `rclBoundary` to confine it to, min/max track sizes, and an `fs` field of
`TF_*` flags [`pmwin.h:3576-3588`]: which edges move (`TF_LEFT`/`TF_TOP`/`TF_RIGHT`/`TF_BOTTOM`, or
`TF_MOVE` = all four, moving rather than sizing), plus `TF_GRID`, `TF_STANDARD`,
`TF_ALLINBOUNDARY` / `TF_PARTINBOUNDARY` and `TF_SETPOINTERPOS`.

### Keyboard message [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1385-1408`]

`WM_CHAR` (`0x007a`) delivers every keystroke. `mp1` low word is the **key-flags** word (`KC_*`),
which tells the receiver which fields of the message are valid:

| Flag | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KC_CHAR` | `0x0001` | A character code is present. |
| `KC_VIRTUALKEY` | `0x0002` | A virtual-key code (`VK_*`) is present. |
| `KC_SCANCODE` | `0x0004` | A hardware scan code is present. |
| `KC_SHIFT` | `0x0008` | Shift was down. |
| `KC_CTRL` | `0x0010` | Ctrl was down. |
| `KC_ALT` | `0x0020` | Alt was down. |
| `KC_KEYUP` | `0x0040` | This is a key-release (else key-press). |
| `KC_PREVDOWN` | `0x0080` | The key was already down (auto-repeat). |
| `KC_LONEKEY` | `0x0100` | A shift key pressed and released alone. |
| `KC_DEADKEY` | `0x0200` | A dead key. |

`mp1` also carries the repeat count and scan code; `mp2` carries the character code and
virtual-key code. `WM_VIOCHAR` (`0x007b`) is the advanced-VIO keystroke variant.

#### `F10` never reaches the focus window [OBS-RE]

PM reserves **F10** for activating the frame's action bar, and takes it before `WM_CHAR` is
delivered. A control cannot see it however correctly it is written — a `case VK_F10` in its `WM_CHAR`
handler is dead code.

Measured by probing every `KC_VIRTUALKEY` message a focused custom control received: pressing
**Shift+F10** delivered `VK_SHIFT` (`0x09`) and nothing else, while `VK_LEFT` (`0x15`) arrived
normally in the same build. The control had focus throughout — `Ctrl+End` reached it and moved the
caret.

This matters when porting, because **Win32 gives Shift+F10 to the application for free**: the system
synthesises `WM_CONTEXTMENU` from it, so Win32 code that opens a context menu from the keyboard
usually has no explicit F10 handling to port, and writing the obvious equivalent produces a key
binding that never fires and no diagnostic anywhere. The route on PM is an **accelerator on the
frame** (`VK_F10, IDM_..., VIRTUALKEY, SHIFT`), which does fire, with the frame then calling into the
control — see `recipes/porting-a-windows-app.md`.

#### A window MUST pass keys it does not use to `WinDefWindowProc` [DOC-IBM]

`WM_CHAR` "is sent by controls to their owner window if they do not process the key stroke
themselves … the most common means by which the input focus is switched around the various controls
in a dialog box" [DOC-IBM — `pm3.txt`, *WM_CHAR (in Frame Controls)*]. The forwarding is done by the
default procedure: "The default window procedure **sends the message to the owner window if it
exists**, otherwise it takes no action on this message other than to set `rc` to FALSE" [DOC-IBM —
`pm3.txt`, *WM_CHAR Default Processing*].

**So returning `FALSE` from your own window procedure is not the same as not handling the key.** A
`return MRFROMLONG(FALSE)` never reaches `WinDefWindowProc`, so the message never travels up the
owner chain, and everything that depends on that chain silently stops working:

- **frame menu mnemonics** — the menu pulls down and then ignores every keystroke;
- Tab / Backtab focus movement between controls;
- arrow-key movement within a control group;
- Enter and Escape reaching the dialog's default and cancel buttons.

*Tell:* the letter you pressed appears **inside the focused control** instead of activating the
menu item. Consume a key only when you actually used it; otherwise fall through to
`WinDefWindowProc`. [OBS-RE — a Scintilla control that returned `FALSE` for unhandled keys made a
correctly-built menu bar completely inert.]

#### Ctrl+letter arrives as the ASCII control code, not the letter [OBS-RE]

`Ctrl+A` … `Ctrl+Z` are delivered as `KC_CHAR` with the character code **1–26**, not `'A'`–`'Z'`.
A handler that only inspects printable characters (`ch >= 32`) never sees any Ctrl shortcut at all.
Recover the letter with `'A' + (ch - 1)` before dispatching, and check `KC_CTRL` in the flags word.

#### The traditional OS/2 editing keys [DOC-IBM]

Users expect the CUA bindings, which IBM documents for the built-in text controls [DOC-IBM —
`pmv2base.txt`, entry-field and MLE sections]:

| Keystroke | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Insert` | Copy |
| `Shift+Insert` | Paste |
| `Shift+Delete` | Cut |

`WC_ENTRYFIELD` and `WC_MLE` implement these themselves (via `EM_COPY`/`EM_CUT`/`EM_PASTE` and
`MLM_*`). **A custom editing control must provide them explicitly** — normally as accelerators
(§ `resources-and-dialogs.md` 9). Ship them *alongside* the Windows-style `Ctrl+C`/`V`/`X`, not
instead of them.

---

## 7. Painting [DOC-IBM]

A window paints in response to `WM_PAINT`. Painting is bracketed by `WinBeginPaint` /
`WinEndPaint`, which yield and release a **presentation space** (`HPS`) clipped to the window's
invalid region; the actual drawing is done with the Gpi functions on that `HPS` (see
`pm-graphics.md`).

| Symbol | Prototype (from `pmwin.h`) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinBeginPaint` | `HPS APIENTRY WinBeginPaint(HWND hwnd, HPS hps, PRECTL prclPaint)` | Begin painting; returns a cached or supplied `HPS` and fills `*prclPaint` with the rectangle to redraw. Pass `hps` = `NULLHANDLE` to obtain a cache PS. |
| `WinEndPaint` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinEndPaint(HPS hps)` | End painting; validates the region and releases a cache PS. |
| `WinGetPS` | `HPS APIENTRY WinGetPS(HWND hwnd)` | Obtain a PS for the whole window outside a `WM_PAINT`. |
| `WinReleasePS` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinReleasePS(HPS hps)` | Release a `WinGetPS` presentation space. |
| `WinOpenWindowDC` | `HDC APIENTRY WinOpenWindowDC(HWND hwnd)` | Open the window's device context. |
| `WinInvalidateRect` / `WinInvalidateRegion` | — | Mark a region invalid, causing a later `WM_PAINT`. Its third argument decides whether *descendants* are invalidated too — see the note below. |
| `WinValidateRect` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinValidateRect(HWND hwnd, PRECTL prcl, BOOL fIncludeChildren)` [`pmwin.h:854-856`] | The inverse: remove a rectangle from the update region, cancelling the pending paint for it. |
| `WinQueryUpdateRect` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinQueryUpdateRect(HWND hwnd, PRECTL prcl)` [`pmwin.h:876-877`] | The pending invalid rectangle, **without** beginning a paint. `WinQueryUpdateRegion` [`pmwin.h:879`] gives the region form. |
| `WinScrollWindow` | `LONG APIENTRY WinScrollWindow(HWND hwnd, LONG dx, LONG dy, PRECTL prclScroll, PRECTL prclClip, HRGN hrgnUpdate, PRECTL prclUpdate, ULONG fs)` [`pmwin.h:364-371`] | Blit a rectangle of the window by (`dx`,`dy`) instead of repainting it. |
| `WinFillRect` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinFillRect(HPS hps, PRECTL prcl, LONG lColor)` | Fill a rectangle with a color. Fills the **left and bottom** edges but **not** the right and top (see boundary rule below). |

`WinScrollWindow` is how a scrolling view avoids redrawing everything: it moves the pixels that are
still valid and leaves only the newly exposed strip to paint. Pass `SW_INVALIDATERGN` in `fs` to
have that exposed area added to the update region automatically, which produces the `WM_PAINT` for
it; without that flag you are responsible for invalidating it yourself, and the strip keeps stale
pixels. The two flags are `SW_SCROLLCHILDREN` (`0x0001`) and `SW_INVALIDATERGN` (`0x0002`)
[`pmwin.h:386-387`] — child windows are **not** scrolled unless you ask. `prclScroll` = `NULL`
scrolls the whole window. Note the sign convention follows PM's
Y-up coordinates, so scrolling the *content* up one line is a **negative** `dy`. [DOC-IBM
`pmv2base.txt` — "If you set the `SW_INVALIDATERGN` flag for this function, the areas you uncover by
scrolling are added to the window's update region automatically".]

> **Invalidating a window that is fully covered by a child repaints nothing visible.** The common
> layout — a client window whose entire area is one child control — means every pixel the user sees
> belongs to the child, so `WinInvalidateRect(hwndClient, NULL, TRUE)` schedules a `WM_PAINT` for a
> window with no exposed area. The symptom is stale pixels left behind by something that used to be
> on top (a dismissed modal dialog is the usual culprit), which then clear as soon as anything makes
> the child redraw for its own reasons — so it reads as an intermittent painting glitch rather than a
> missing call. Invalidate the window that actually owns the pixels. [OBS-RE — a file dialog's
> footprint stayed on screen after it closed, until the editor scrolled.]

> **`WM_CONTROL`'s `mp2` is not one type — switch on the notification code before you dereference
> it.** A single control multiplexes every notification it has through one message, and each code
> defines `mp2` independently: some send a pointer to a structure, some send a handle, some send
> nothing. Reading `mp2` as a pointer without first checking `SHORT2FROMMP(mp1)` therefore
> dereferences whatever the *other* notifications happen to put there — a window handle is a small
> integer, so this is a wild pointer, not a null one, and it faults rather than failing gracefully.
>
> The bug hides well: a handler is usually written while testing one notification, and the wrong
> branch only runs when some *other* notification arrives — which may be gated behind a feature flag
> that is off by default. In one case a Scintilla control's `SCEN_CHANGE` (which puts an `HWND` in
> `mp2`) was being read as the `SCNotification *` that its other notifications pass, and the crash
> stayed dormant until a settings file first restored the guarding feature as enabled. [OBS-RE]
>
> Corollary worth generalising: **adding settings persistence changes your startup conditions**, so
> it wakes latent bugs in code that only ever ran with defaults. Expect a round of them, and bisect
> the settings file — by section, then by key — rather than re-reading the parser.

### Presentation-space ownership — which `HPS` may be released, and how [DOC-IBM]

There are two kinds of `HPS` and they are released differently; releasing the wrong kind, or using a
handle after release, is a defect the API will not report.

- **`WinGetPS` returns a cache "micro presentation space"** [DOC-IBM — `pm2.txt`, *WinGetPS*],
  intended "for simple drawing operations that do not depend on long-term data being stored in the
  presentation space." Its initial state matches a `GpiCreatePS` space, with the color table in
  default color-index mode.
- **`WinReleasePS` releases *only* cache presentation spaces** [DOC-IBM — `pm2.txt`,
  *WinReleasePS*]: "Only cache presentation spaces can be released using this method, after which the
  presentation space is returned to the cache to be used again. **The presentation-space handle
  should not be used following this call.**"
- **`WinBeginPaint` behaves differently depending on what you pass** [DOC-IBM — `pm2.txt`,
  *WinBeginPaint*]: with an existing PS, "its update region is set and the device context of the
  window is associated with the presentation space"; otherwise "a cache presentation space is
  obtained specifically for the window." Either way the window's update region is reset to
  `NULLHANDLE`, and it is *assumed* that the drawing which follows restores the window to a fully
  correct state — PM will not ask again.
- **`WinEndPaint` unwinds whichever it was** [DOC-IBM — `pm2.txt`, *WinEndPaint*]: a cache PS "is
  returned to the cache"; other presentation spaces "have their original drawing state restored,
  including reassociating the original device context (if there was one)."

The practical rule for a port: a PS you obtained from the cache (`WinGetPS`, or `WinBeginPaint` with
`NULLHANDLE`) is borrowed and must be given back within the same handler, and the handle is dead
afterwards. A PS you created with `GpiCreatePS` is yours and outlives the paint bracket.

> **Rectangle boundary rule** — a `RECTL` includes its **left and bottom** edges and excludes its
> **right and top** (inclusive on the *origin-side* edges, since the origin is bottom-left), with the
> top-left and bottom-right corner points included as an exception. Full statement and the
> `WinDrawBorder` counterpart: `gpi-drawing.md` §"Rectangle boundary rule".

The canonical `WM_PAINT` handler [DOC]:

```c
case WM_PAINT: {
    RECTL rcl;
    HPS hps = WinBeginPaint(hwnd, NULLHANDLE, &rcl);
    /* draw with Gpi calls on hps, clipped to rcl */
    WinEndPaint(hps);
    return 0;
}
```

## 8. Dialogs [DOC-IBM]

A dialog is a frame whose child controls are described by a **dialog template** resource, loaded
from a module. A dialog has its own procedure with the same `PFNWP` signature; unhandled messages
go to `WinDefDlgProc` (the dialog analogue of `WinDefWindowProc`).

| Symbol | Prototype (from `pmwin.h`) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinLoadDlg` | `HWND APIENTRY WinLoadDlg(HWND hwndParent, HWND hwndOwner, PFNWP pfnDlgProc, HMODULE hmod, ULONG idDlg, PVOID pCreateParams)` | Create a dialog from a template resource and return its handle (modeless — the caller must run/dispatch it). |
| `WinDlgBox` | `ULONG APIENTRY WinDlgBox(HWND hwndParent, HWND hwndOwner, PFNWP pfnDlgProc, HMODULE hmod, ULONG idDlg, PVOID pCreateParams)` | Load, run **modally**, and destroy a dialog in one call; returns the id passed to `WinDismissDlg`. |
| `WinProcessDlg` | `ULONG APIENTRY WinProcessDlg(HWND hwndDlg)` | Run a (previously loaded) dialog's modal loop; returns the dismiss result. |
| `WinDismissDlg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinDismissDlg(HWND hwndDlg, ULONG usResult)` | End a modal dialog, making `WinProcessDlg`/`WinDlgBox` return `usResult`. |
| `WinDefDlgProc` | `MRESULT APIENTRY WinDefDlgProc(HWND hwndDlg, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2)` | Default dialog message handling. |
| `WinGetDlgMsg` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinGetDlgMsg(HWND hwndDlg, PQMSG pqmsg)` | Message-loop helper for modeless dialogs. |
| `WinSendDlgItemMsg` | `MRESULT APIENTRY WinSendDlgItemMsg(HWND hwndDlg, ULONG idItem, ULONG msg, MPARAM mp1, MPARAM mp2)` | Send a message to a control by id. |
| `WinQueryDlgItemText` / `WinSetDlgItemText` | — | Get/set a control's text by id. |
| `WinQueryDlgItemShort` / `WinSetDlgItemShort` | — | Get/set a control's numeric value. |

A dialog procedure receives **`WM_INITDLG`** (`0x003b`) instead of `WM_CREATE`, at which point all
its controls exist and can be initialized; `mp1` is the focus window and `mp2` is the
`pCreateParams` passed to `WinLoadDlg`/`WinDlgBox`.

**Standard item ids** [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1626-1628`]: `DID_OK` (1), `DID_CANCEL` (2), `DID_ERROR`
(`0xffff`). These are the values conventionally passed to `WinDismissDlg`.

### Message boxes [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1650-1758`]

`WinMessageBox(HWND hwndParent, HWND hwndOwner, PSZ pszText, PSZ pszCaption, ULONG idWindow,
ULONG flStyle)` displays a standard message box and returns the button chosen (`MBID_*`). `flStyle`
combines a button set — `MB_OK` (`0x0000`), `MB_OKCANCEL` (`0x0001`), `MB_RETRYCANCEL` (`0x0002`),
`MB_ABORTRETRYIGNORE` (`0x0003`), `MB_YESNO` (`0x0004`), `MB_YESNOCANCEL` (`0x0005`),
`MB_CANCEL` (`0x0006`) — an icon — `MB_ICONQUESTION` (`0x0010`), `MB_ICONEXCLAMATION` (`0x0020`),
`MB_ICONASTERISK`/`MB_INFORMATION` (`0x0030`), `MB_ICONHAND` (`0x0040`) — a default button
(`MB_DEFBUTTON1`/`2`/`3` = `0x0000`/`0x0100`/`0x0200`), and modality (`MB_APPLMODAL` `0x0000`,
`MB_SYSTEMMODAL` `0x1000`, `MB_MOVEABLE` `0x4000`). Return values are `MBID_OK` (1),
`MBID_CANCEL` (2), `MBID_ABORT` (3), `MBID_RETRY` (4), `MBID_IGNORE` (5), `MBID_YES` (6),
`MBID_NO` (7), `MBID_HELP` (8), `MBID_ENTER` (9), `MBID_ERROR` (`0xffff`).

`WinAlarm(HWND hwndDesktop, ULONG rgfType)` sounds an alarm: `WA_WARNING` (0), `WA_NOTE` (1),
`WA_ERROR` (2) [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:1631-1638`].

## 9. Window words [DOC-IBM]

Each window has a block of per-window storage — reserved at class registration via
`WinRegisterClass`'s `cbWindowData`, plus a set of predefined slots — read and written by index:

| Symbol | Prototype | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinQueryWindowULong` | `ULONG APIENTRY WinQueryWindowULong(HWND hwnd, LONG index)` | Read a 32-bit window word. |
| `WinSetWindowULong` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinSetWindowULong(HWND hwnd, LONG index, ULONG ul)` | Write a 32-bit window word. |
| `WinQueryWindowUShort` | `USHORT APIENTRY WinQueryWindowUShort(HWND hwnd, LONG index)` | Read a 16-bit window word. |
| `WinSetWindowUShort` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinSetWindowUShort(HWND hwnd, LONG index, USHORT us)` | Write a 16-bit window word. |
| `WinQueryWindowPtr` | `PVOID APIENTRY WinQueryWindowPtr(HWND hwnd, LONG index)` | Read a pointer window word. |
| `WinSetWindowPtr` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinSetWindowPtr(HWND hwnd, LONG index, PVOID p)` | Write a pointer window word. |

**Standard indices** [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:797-813`]:

| Index | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `QWL_USER` / `QWS_USER` | `0` | First application word (base of `cbWindowData`). |
| `QWS_ID` | `-1` | Window (child) id. |
| `QWL_STYLE` | `-2` | Window style bits. |
| `QWP_PFNWP` | `-3` | The window procedure pointer. |
| `QWL_HMQ` | `-4` | The window's message queue. |
| `QWL_RESERVED` | `-5` | Reserved. |

Provenance: **[DOC-IBM]** `pmwin.h:776-813`.

## 10. Timers [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:3461-3475`]

A window timer delivers a periodic `WM_TIMER` to a window:

| Symbol | Prototype | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WinStartTimer` | `ULONG APIENTRY WinStartTimer(HAB hab, HWND hwnd, ULONG idTimer, ULONG dtTimeout)` | Start a timer with id `idTimer` firing every `dtTimeout` milliseconds; `WM_TIMER` is posted to `hwnd`. Returns the timer id (or, if `hwnd` is `NULLHANDLE`, an allocated id). |
| `WinStopTimer` | `BOOL APIENTRY WinStopTimer(HAB hab, HWND hwnd, ULONG idTimer)` | Stop a timer. |
| `WinGetCurrentTime` | `ULONG APIENTRY WinGetCurrentTime(HAB hab)` | Current PM time in milliseconds. |

Reserved timer ids: `TID_CURSOR` (`0xffff`), `TID_SCROLL` (`0xfffe`), `TID_FLASHWINDOW`
(`0xfffd`); `TID_USERMAX` (`0x7fff`) is the highest application timer id. `WM_TIMER` (`0x0024`)
delivers the firing timer's id in `SHORT1FROMMP(mp1)`.

## 11. System values [DOC-IBM]

`WinQuerySysValue(HWND hwndDesktop, LONG iSysValue)` returns a system-wide metric or setting;
`WinSetSysValue(HWND hwndDesktop, LONG iSysValue, LONG lValue)` changes a settable one. Selected
`SV_*` indices [DOC-IBM `pmwin.h:3000-3083`]:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SV_SWAPBUTTON` | `0` | Mouse buttons swapped (left-handed). |
| `SV_DBLCLKTIME` | `1` | Double-click interval (ms). |
| `SV_CXDBLCLK` / `SV_CYDBLCLK` | `2` / `3` | Double-click sensitivity box. |
