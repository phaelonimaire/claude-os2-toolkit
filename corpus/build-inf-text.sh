# build-inf-text.sh - turn IBM .INF/.HLP books into greppable UTF-8 text.
#
# This is the highest-value corpus step: the IBM programming books hold the
# usage patterns, contracts and worked examples that headers do not, but they
# ship as compiled IPF binaries. Extracted, they become the substrate that
# answers "how is this actually used" instead of just "what is the prototype".
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-inf-text.sh [DIR-OR-FILE ...]
#
# With no arguments it scans a default set of likely locations (see SCAN below).
# Output goes to $OS2DOCS/inf_text/<book>.txt  (OS2DOCS defaults to ~/os2docs).
#
# Re-running is cheap: a book is re-extracted only if its source is newer than
# the existing text. Safe to run after adding more books.
#
# RIGHTS: the books are IBM's. This script converts material you already have;
# it downloads nothing and it does not give you the right to redistribute the
# output. Keep the corpus local. See ../sources.md.
